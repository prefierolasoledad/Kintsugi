/**
 * How far behind the channel workers are, and how much is in the dead-letter
 * queue.
 *
 * WHY LAG IS THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS
 * Everything else about this pipeline can look healthy while it is failing.
 * The API answers, the relay publishes, the outbox drains, every worker process
 * is up — and notifications still arrive four hours late because one consumer
 * group is not keeping up. Nothing already exposed would show that: the outbox
 * is empty precisely BECAUSE the events were published successfully.
 *
 * Lag is the difference between what has been produced and what a group has
 * committed. It is the only figure that answers "is anyone actually getting
 * these".
 *
 * WHY THE DLQ IS REPORTED AS A DEPTH AND NOT AS AN EVENT
 * A message reaching the dead-letter queue is not urgent on its own — the
 * ladder took sixteen minutes to give up on it and one failure is usually a
 * bad address. A DLQ that is GROWING is the incident. So the depth is exposed
 * for something else to threshold and alert on, rather than this endpoint
 * deciding what counts as an emergency.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
 * It does not alert. There is no alerting stack here, and pretending otherwise
 * would be worse than saying so — see docs/adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md,
 * which draws the same line around a Postgres standby with no orchestrator.
 * What it does is make the number scrapeable, with a `healthy` flag so a
 * monitor does not have to encode the thresholds itself.

 * Lag above which the pipeline is reported unhealthy.

 * minute of backlog — comfortably above a normal burst and well below the point
