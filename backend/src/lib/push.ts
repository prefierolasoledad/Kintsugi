/**
 * Web Push.
 *
 * WHY WEB PUSH AND NOT FCM OR APNs
 * There is no mobile app. Web Push works in the browser that is already open,
 * needs no store listing, no native build and no signing certificates, and one
 * subscription covers desktop and Android. iOS supports it only for pages added
 * to the home screen — that is the honest limit, and it is stated in the UI
 * rather than discovered.
 *
 * WHAT VAPID IS FOR
 * The keypair identifies this server to the browser's push service. The private
 * half signs each request; the public half is handed to the browser at
 * subscribe time and is baked into the subscription, so ROTATING IT INVALIDATES
 * EVERY EXISTING SUBSCRIPTION. Not a secret rotation to do casually.
 *
 * See docs/plans/0001-multi-channel-notifications.md, phase 3.
