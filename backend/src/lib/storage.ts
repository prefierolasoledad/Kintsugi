/**
 * Where uploaded images live.
 *
 * Two drivers behind one interface — `put`, `remove`, and a public URL — chosen
 * by `STORAGE_DRIVER`. Everything above this module knows only those three
 * things, which is what [ADR 0011] promised when it said the seam would be
 * "swapped for S3/R2/Cloudinary by reimplementing two functions".
 *
 * WHY THIS STOPPED BEING OPTIONAL
 * Local disk is not merely a development shortcut. It is the last thing
 * preventing a second API replica: two containers with separate disks serve
 * different sets of photos, so a browser gets an image or a 404 depending on
 * which replica answered. Rate limits and the cache moved to Redis
 * (ADR 0018, ADR 0019) and the refresh race moved to Postgres (ADR 0021); this
 * was what remained.
 *
 * It also breaks the Compose stack outright: the browser loads photos from
 * `localhost:4000`, which the host can reach and the web container cannot, so
 * every seller photo 404s in a page the frontend renders perfectly.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0022-object-storage-for-uploads.md
