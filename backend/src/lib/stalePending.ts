/**
 * Resolves deliveries that were claimed and never settled.
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, AND HOW IT WAS FOUND
 * The ledger claims a delivery BEFORE calling the provider, which is what makes
 * a redelivery safe. The cost is a window: a consumer killed between the claim
 * and the settle leaves a `PENDING` row, and on redelivery that row collides
 * with the strict claim and is read as an ordinary duplicate. Nothing sends,
 * nothing retries, and the row looks like proof the work was done.
 *
 * ADR 0026 calls this the ambiguous middle and specifies exactly this sweeper.
 * It went unbuilt through four phases. `scripts/consumer-failure-demo.ts` is
 * what made it undeniable: it had to be taught that a `PENDING` row is a LOSS
 * and not a delivery, because its first version counted one as success.
 *
 * WHY THE POLICY DIFFERS PER CHANNEL, WHICH LOOKS LIKE INCONSISTENCY
 * It is not. The outcome is unknown either way — no email or SMS provider
 * offers "did you already accept this?" keyed by our id — so every option here
 * is a guess, and the right guess depends on what a wrong one costs.
 *
 *   Email, push   RESEND. A duplicate is a minor annoyance; a missing refund
 *                 notice is not. Push additionally collapses on the device by
 *                 tag, so a duplicate is often invisible.
 *   SMS           NEVER RESEND. Mark FAILED for a human. A duplicate text
 *                 costs real money and, worse, reads like a phishing retry to
 *                 the recipient — who cannot tell one from the other.
 *
 * Encoding that next to the channel is what stops somebody applying the email
 * policy to SMS because it was the default.

/**
 * How long a `PENDING` row has to sit before it is presumed abandoned.
 *
 * Generously long on purpose. A row is legitimately `PENDING` for as long as a
 * provider call takes, and SMTP to a slow host can take tens of seconds. Ten
 * minutes is far beyond any real call and far short of anyone noticing a
 * missing notification.
