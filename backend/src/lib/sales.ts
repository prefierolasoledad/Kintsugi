/**
 * What a seller has sold, and sending it.
 *
 * WHY THIS DID NOT EXIST
 * Order lines carried a `sellerName` string and nothing else, so there was no
 * way to ask "what did I sell?". Someone could buy a chair and the seller would
 * never be told, never see it, and never be able to act on it. The marketplace
 * loop was open at exactly the point where a real transaction begins.
 *
 * ONLY ORDERS WHERE MONEY MOVED
 * A seller sees a line once the money has actually moved. Showing them a
 * PENDING_PAYMENT order would have them packing parcels for checkouts that get
 * abandoned — and roughly half of all abandoned carts sit in that state until a
 * sweeper releases them.
 *
 * That USED to mean status PAID alone, which was right when PAID was the only
 * post-payment state. It is not any more: a fully refunded order becomes
 * REFUNDED, and filtering on PAID made those sales disappear from the seller's
 * list, their summary, and their totals as though the transaction had never
 * happened. They need to see it, marked refunded.
 *
 * VISIBILITY AND EARNINGS ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
 * A refunded line is still a sale that happened, so it is visible. It is not
 * money the seller keeps, so it is excluded from soldCount and grossCents.
 * Conflating the two would either hide history or inflate earnings, and both
 * are worse than carrying two filters.
 */

/**
 * Order states in which the money moved, so the seller has a real sale.
 *
 * One constant rather than six copies of the same array: this filter appears in
 * every seller-facing query, and a single site left on PAID alone is a sale that
 * silently vanishes from one screen but not the others.
