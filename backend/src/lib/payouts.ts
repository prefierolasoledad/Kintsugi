 * What a seller is owed, and what they are not.
 *
 * NO MONEY MOVES IN THIS FILE. It is the query that decides eligibility, and it
 * is deliberately separate from lib/payoutProvider.ts: an adapter that both
 * talks to Stripe and decides who gets paid is one where changing provider can
 * quietly change the rules.
 *
 * THE FIVE CONDITIONS, from docs/adr/0030-payout-eligibility-and-hold.md. An
 * order item is payable when ALL of these hold, and each one is here because
 * the others are not sufficient:
 *
 *   1. the order is PAID              — an unpaid order has no money to split
 *   2. the item is DELIVERED          — SHIPPED is the seller's own claim
 *   3. deliveredAt is past the hold   — the window a refund usually arrives in
 *   4. nothing is refunded against it — a refunded item was never earned
 *   5. it has never been paid before  — enforced by a constraint, not by this
 *
 * Condition 5 is checked here as an optimisation and enforced by
 * `payout_items.orderItemId @unique`. This query is the fast path; the
 * constraint is the guarantee. Two concurrent payout runs both pass this check
 * and exactly one survives the insert.
 */
