/**
 * The delivery ledger: what was sent, on which channel, and what came back.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 * Everything upstream delivers at least once on purpose. The relay publishes
 * and then marks publishedAt, so a crash between them republishes. A Kafka
 * consumer that sends and then dies before committing its offset reprocesses on
 * restart. A rebalance during a rolling deploy hands a partition back at the
 * last committed offset. None of those are failures — they are Tuesday.
 *
 * Without a record of what has already been sent, each one is a second email,
 * and later a second SMS.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
 *   1. resolve preferences; if off, write SUPPRESSED and stop
 *   2. INSERT PENDING — a unique violation means somebody else has it, return
 *   3. call the provider
 *   4. update to SENT with its message id, or FAILED with the reason
 *
 * Step 2 is the guard. It is the same discipline as claiming an order before
 * charging it (ADR 0013) and claiming refund headroom before refunding
 * (ADR 0016): mutual exclusion is decided by whether a write matched, and only
 * the winner may talk to the provider. There is no window between checking and
 * claiming, because the check IS the claim.
 *
 * Checking first and inserting after would reintroduce the read-then-write race
 * that ADR 0012 exists to prevent — two consumers both read "no row", both
 * decide to send, and both send.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0026-delivery-idempotency.md
