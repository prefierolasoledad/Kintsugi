 *
 * `notify()` opens its own transaction and swallows its own errors, on the
 * grounds that failing to tell somebody their item sold must never roll back
 * the sale (ADR 0024). That is right for a sale: the sale is the important
 * thing and the notification is a side effect of it.
 *
 * Here the message IS the thing, and a message nobody is told about is worse
 * than a send that visibly failed — the seller would sit waiting for a reply to
 * something the moderator queue never showed. So the message, the unread
 * counters, the notification row and the outbox event commit together or not at
 * all, and a failure propagates to the caller so the UI can say "that didn't
 * send, try again".
 *
 * Returns the recipients so the caller can invalidate their badge caches AFTER
 * the commit — same ordering as `notifyMany`, for the same reason: a cache
 * invalidation that fails must not roll back the thing it was invalidating for.
