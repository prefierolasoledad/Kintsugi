/**
 * How a published event gets from the relay to the consumers.
 *
 * TWO TRANSPORTS, ONE INTERFACE — the same shape as the payment and identity
 * seams, and for the same reason.
 *
 *   inline  the relay calls the consumer functions in-process. No broker. The
 *           default, and what the suite and CI run against: 870 assertions
 *           should not wait on a Kafka cluster, and a pull request from a fork
 *           must pass without one.
 *
 *   kafka   the real transport. Local, and everywhere real.
 *
 * WHAT `inline` STILL TESTS, WHICH IS ALMOST EVERYTHING. The outbox write, the
 * transaction it shares with the notification, the relay's claim query, the
 * consumer handlers, and (from phase 2) preference resolution and the
 * idempotency guard all run exactly as they do in production. Only the wire is
 * missing. What it cannot show is rebalance behaviour, offset commit ordering,
 * and the retry ladder — which is why those get their own broker-gated suite
 * rather than being assumed.
