/**
 * Unsubscribe links that work without signing in.
 *
 * AN UNSUBSCRIBE THAT REQUIRES A PASSWORD IS AN UNSUBSCRIBE PEOPLE REPLACE WITH
 * THE SPAM BUTTON, and a spam report costs the sending domain far more than the
 * mail it was objecting to. So the link carries its own authority.
 *
 * That means the token has to be unguessable and unforgeable, and it must not
 * be a session. It authorises exactly one thing: turning off one channel for
 * one event type — or all optional mail — for the user it names. It cannot log
 * anybody in, read anything, or turn a notification back on.
 *
 * WHY NO EXPIRY
 * A link in a two-year-old email is exactly when somebody wants to unsubscribe,
 * and an expired one sends them to a page that says no. The token stays valid
 * for as long as the secret does. Rotating JWT_SECRET invalidates every
 * outstanding link along with every session, which is the correct blast radius.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0027-notification-consent-and-preferences.md

 * back to the main secret and undo the separation.

 * because that is what promises a single POST will do the job with no page to
 * click through. Without it, people use the spam button instead, and that is
 * the outcome this whole mechanism exists to avoid.
 *
 * The POST target is the API directly. The mailto and the browser link go to
 * the frontend page, which asks for a confirmation — because a link in an email
 * gets fetched by scanners and prefetchers that would otherwise silently
 * unsubscribe people who never clicked anything.
