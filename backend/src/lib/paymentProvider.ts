/**
 * Payment provider.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEAM
 * Card details must never reach this application. PCI scope is enormous and
 * entirely avoidable: the provider collects the card, we hold a reference to
 * the resulting payment. Same reasoning as lib/kycProvider.ts — the sensitive
 * thing stays with the party built to hold it.
 *
 * TWO ADAPTERS, ONE INTERFACE
 *   stub   — no account needed, deterministic outcomes, in-process state.
 *   stripe — real Stripe test mode / sandbox, driven by test payment methods.
 * Both are state machines, and that is the point: an intent that has already
 * succeeded cannot succeed again in either mode, so the code above behaves the
 * same way whichever is configured.
 *
 * The interface follows Stripe's PaymentIntents because that is what it wraps:
 *   createIntent()  ~ stripe.paymentIntents.create()
 *   confirmIntent() ~ stripe.paymentIntents.confirm()
 *   getIntent()     ~ stripe.paymentIntents.retrieve()  (used to reconcile)
 *   verifyWebhook() ~ stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY
 * Every mutating call takes an idempotencyKey. This is the layer that survives
 * what a lock cannot: if we send a request, Stripe charges the card, and the
 * response is lost to a timeout or a restart, we do not know whether money
 * moved. Retrying with the same key returns Stripe's original result instead of
 * charging a second time. Keys must therefore be derived from stable data — the
 * order id — never randomly generated per attempt, which would protect nothing.
 * Stripe retains keys for 24 hours.
 *
 * PAYMENT_PROVIDER=stub is the default so development needs no account. Stripe
 * signup is invite-only in some countries, so an account cannot be assumed.
