/**
 * Admin authentication — deliberately a second, separate thing.
 *
 * WHY SIGNING IN NORMALLY DOES NOT OPEN THE PANEL
 * The two most common ways an admin panel gets reached are a stolen storefront
 * session and a compromised email inbox (password reset → account → admin).
 * Both stop short here: the shopping session carries no admin rights at all,
 * and re-authentication requires a factor that email cannot provide.
 *
 * So there are two sessions. The ordinary one lasts weeks and lets you buy a
 * chair. The admin one lasts thirty minutes, needs the password again plus a
 * TOTP code, and is signed with a different secret so one cannot be forged from
 * the other.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 * Not SSO. Real companies put staff behind an identity provider with enforced
 * MFA and deprovisioning tied to HR — that is the actual industry standard, and
 * it needs an IdP this project does not have. This is the strongest thing
 * buildable without one, and the gap is recorded rather than hidden.
