 * Orders.
 *
 * WHERE STOCK LIVES AT EACH STAGE
 *   hold (HELD reservation)  — stock committed, expires in 15 minutes
 *   order (PENDING_PAYMENT)  — stock committed, reservation now CONVERTED
 *   order (PROCESSING)       — stock committed, a payment is in flight
 *   order (PAID)             — listing SOLD, permanent
 *   order (FAILED/CANCELLED) — stock returned, listing ACTIVE again
 *
 * The reservation converts at order creation, not at payment success. If it
 * stayed HELD, the 15-minute sweeper would hand the stock to someone else while
 * the buyer was mid-payment — and the first person to learn would be whoever
 * paid for an item that had already gone.
 *
 * That moves the responsibility: an unpaid order now holds stock, so an
 * abandoned one has to expire too. releaseAbandonedOrders() does that. Without
 * it, an order nobody completes hides a listing forever — the same deadlock the
 * reservation sweeper exists to prevent (ADR 0012).

/**
 * Claims the order for payment, and reports whether this caller won.
 *
 * THIS IS THE DOUBLE-PAYMENT GUARD.

 * Reading the status and then charging the card is two steps, and two
 * concurrent requests both complete step one before either finishes step two.
 * Both see PENDING_PAYMENT, both conclude they are first, both charge. That is
 * not a theoretical race — before this existed, five simultaneous requests
 * produced five successful charges in testing.
 *
 * A single conditional UPDATE closes it. Postgres serialises writes to a row,
 * so of N concurrent statements exactly one matches PENDING_PAYMENT and moves
 * it to PROCESSING; the rest match nothing and get count 0. Only the winner may
 * talk to the provider. There is no window between checking and claiming
 * because they are the same statement.
 *
 * WHY NOT A LOCK
 * A Redis or advisory lock has a lease. If the provider call outlives it — a
 * slow issuer, a 3-D Secure prompt — the lease expires while the charge is
 * still in flight and a second caller acquires it cleanly. Raising the timeout
 * moves the window rather than closing it. This state lives in the same
 * durable store as the order, so there is no lease to expire and no split
 * brain between "the lock says I own this" and what the data says.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
 * A process that dies between claiming and hearing back leaves the order in
 * PROCESSING with a charge of unknown status. No mutual exclusion can fix that
 * — the request that knew is gone. That is what the provider's idempotency key
 * and reconcileProcessingOrders() are for.
