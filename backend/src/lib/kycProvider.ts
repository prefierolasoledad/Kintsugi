/**
 * Identity verification provider.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN ABSTRACTION, AND WHY THE DEFAULT IS A STUB
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Government ID documents must never be stored by this application. They are
 * special-category personal data (GDPR Art. 9-adjacent; India's DPDP Act treats
 * them similarly), and holding ID images or numbers turns our database into a
 * high-value breach target for no product benefit. Real deployments delegate the
 * check to a provider that is built and audited for it, and keep only a
 * reference to the outcome.
 *
 * TWO ADAPTERS
 *   stub            — deterministic outcomes from a document number, so both
 *                     branches are testable without anyone's real ID.
 *   stripe_identity — real Stripe Identity. The seller is sent to Stripe's
 *                     hosted flow, uploads there, and the result arrives as a
 *                     signed webhook. This process never sees a document.
 *
 * THE STUB IS THE WEAKER PRIVACY MODEL, NOT THE STRONGER ONE
 * The stub accepts a document number into memory because it has to decide
 * something. Stripe Identity removes even that: the number never reaches this
 * server at all. So switching provider does not merely swap an implementation,
 * it shrinks what this application is capable of leaking — which is the reason
 * the seam exists.
 *
 * WHAT WE STORE, EITHER WAY
 * A session id and a status. Stripe keeps the extracted data in a separate
 * VerificationReport that we deliberately never expand, so ADR 0006 is enforced
 * by the provider rather than by our own restraint.
