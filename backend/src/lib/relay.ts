/**
 * The outbox relay: reads committed events and publishes them.
 *
 * WHY IT CLAIMS WITH `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
 * `FOR UPDATE` is the same lock discipline as lib/reservations.ts. `SKIP
 * LOCKED` is what makes more than one relay safe: a row already claimed by
 * another relay is passed over rather than waited on, so N relays divide the
 * backlog instead of queueing behind each other.
 *
 * Without SKIP LOCKED a second relay blocks on the first's batch — correct, but
 * pointless. Without FOR UPDATE at all, two relays read the same unpublished
 * rows and publish every one of them twice.
 *
 * WHY THE PUBLISH HAPPENS INSIDE THE TRANSACTION
 * This is the one place in the codebase where an external call sits inside an
 * open transaction, and it is deliberate. The lock IS the claim: released at
 * commit, so it has to still be held while the publish is in flight or a second
 * relay could claim the same rows mid-publish.
 *
 * The cost is a transaction held open for the duration of a broker round trip,
 * which is bounded by the producer's own timeout and by TX_TIMEOUT_MS below. At
 * one batch a second against a broker in the same network this is single-digit
 * milliseconds. If it ever is not, the fix is a two-phase claim with a
 * `claimedAt` column and a claim-expiry sweep — more moving parts, and not
 * earned yet.
 *
 * WHY PUBLISH-THEN-MARK, AND NOT THE REVERSE
 * A crash between the publish and the commit leaves the rows unpublished, so
 * the next pass publishes them again. That is a duplicate, and duplicates are
 * handled downstream by the delivery ledger (ADR 0026). Marking first would
 * turn the same crash into a lost notification, which nothing downstream can
 * recover, because no record survives saying it was owed.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0024-outbox-not-dual-writes.md
