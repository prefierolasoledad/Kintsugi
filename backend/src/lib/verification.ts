/**
 * Recording an identity decision, and the payout permission that follows it.
 *
 * ONE PLACE, TWO CALLERS
 * The stub is driven by the seller's own submission; Stripe Identity arrives as
 * a webhook. Both end here, because the dangerous part is the same either way:
 * `payoutsEnabled` must never be written without a verified decision recorded
 * beside it, and the two writes must not be able to come apart. A transaction
 * is what guarantees that, and having a second copy of this logic would be one
 * copy that eventually forgets.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT
 * Stripe delivers webhooks at least once and retries on failure, so the same
 * decision can legitimately arrive twice. A repeat is a no-op rather than a
 * second round of writes.
