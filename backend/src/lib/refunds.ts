/**
 * Sending money back.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A seller could mark a line "can't send it" and the buyer's money simply
 * stayed taken. Nothing in the system would ever return it. That was not a
 * missing feature so much as a wrong one: the code recorded that a refund was
 * owed and then had no mechanism to settle it.
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT CALLING THE PROVIDER
 * It is making sure we never send back more than came in, and never send the
 * same money back twice, when two requests arrive together. Both are solved the
 * same way payment claiming is: one conditional UPDATE decides, and only the
 * caller whose UPDATE matched a row is allowed to talk to the provider.
 * See docs/adr/0013-payment-provider-seam.md
