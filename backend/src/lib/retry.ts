/**
 * The retry ladder: where a message goes after a transient failure.
 *
 * WHY A TOPIC AND NOT A SLEEP
 * A consumer that waits in place holds its partition. One recipient behind a
 * provider having a bad minute would stall every other user hashed to that
 * partition, turning a per-recipient failure into a per-channel outage. So the
 * consumer commits its offset, the message waits somewhere else, and a worker
 * reading that somewhere else picks it up once the delay has elapsed. The main
 * partition never stops moving. See ADR 0025.
 *
 * WHY THE ATTEMPT COUNT IS A HEADER AND NOT IN THE EVENT
 * The event body is the domain fact — who, what, when. How many times we have
 * tried to deliver it is transport bookkeeping, and putting it in the payload
 * would mean the bytes a consumer sees differ from the bytes the outbox wrote,
 * which is exactly the sort of drift that makes a replay behave unlike the
 * original run.

 * subscribe to a topic that might not exist yet. Without this header, an email
 * failure republished to retry.5s would also be consumed by push-worker, which
 * would then reprocess a push it already delivered. The ledger would refuse
 * the duplicate and nothing would break — but the work, the log lines, and the
 * confusion are all avoidable for the cost of one header.
