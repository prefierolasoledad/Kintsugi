   * times from one address, it tries one leaked password against thousands of
   * accounts from rotating proxies, and the per-address counter above never
   * sees more than a single attempt from any of them.
   *
   * The version worth having counts only FAILED attempts, so legitimate
   * traffic behind a NAT never accumulates. That needs the limiter to answer
   * "how many so far?" without incrementing, which `checkRateLimit` cannot do
