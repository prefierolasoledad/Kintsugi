 * message and tracking its own offsets — so adding a channel is a new group and
 * no producer change at all. See docs/adr/0025-kafka-topics-and-partitioning.md
 *
 * Run all consumers in one process, or one per process:
 *
 *   node dist/worker.js               every consumer group
 *   node dist/worker.js log-worker    just that one
 *
 * One per process is what a real deployment does, because it is what lets email
 * and SMS scale independently — which is most of why a broker is here at all.
