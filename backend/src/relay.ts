/**
 * The outbox relay, as its own process.
 *
 * WHY NOT A setInterval INSIDE THE API, like the two sweepers
 * `startOrderSweeper` and `startReservationSweeper` are exactly that, and they
 * have the same shape. The difference is what they do: those recover state
 * nothing in the request path can reach, and are idle almost always. This is on
 * the critical path of every notification, and its throughput is the thing that
 * has to scale when volume grows.
 *
 * In the API, scaling publishing would mean scaling the API, and a relay bug
 * would take checkout down with it. Here it is a separate image target, scales
 * on its own, and becomes a Kubernetes Deployment without a rewrite.
 *
 * SEVERAL OF THESE ARE SAFE TO RUN. The claim query uses FOR UPDATE SKIP
 * LOCKED, so N relays divide the backlog rather than duplicating it.
 *
 * Under NOTIFY_TRANSPORT=inline the API runs the relay in-process instead and
 * this program is not used — there is no broker to publish to and nothing to
 * scale, so a second container for a function call would be ceremony.
