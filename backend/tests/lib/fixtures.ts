 * Test accounts and listings, with cleanup that cannot forget.
 *
 * THE MISTAKE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
 * Every suite used to do its own teardown and its own "is the database clean?"
 * check, and those checks were written GLOBALLY: "are any listings SOLD?", "are
 * there any orders?". That reports the site owner's real purchase as leftover
 * test data. I wrote that bug four separate times, chased a phantom leak twice,
 * and once reset a seeded quantity-3 listing to 1 while "tidying up".
 *
 * So a Scope tracks exactly what it touched, restores exactly that, and its
 * verification is scoped by construction. There is no global variant to reach
 * for, because the global variant is the bug.
