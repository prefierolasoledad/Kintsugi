/**
 * A placement negotiated from one end to the other, in a browser.

 * WHAT THIS PROVES THAT THE ROUTE SUITE DOES NOT
 * `placement-routes.ts` drives the same negotiation over HTTP and proves the
 * endpoints and the authorisation. It cannot prove that a seller can FIND any
 * of it, that the counter-offer is legible when it arrives, or that the terms
 * shown on screen are the terms in the database. A feature nobody can reach is
 * indistinguishable from a feature that does not exist.
 *
 * The sequence is deliberately the real one, with two logged-in parties:
 *   seller asks  →  moderator counters  →  seller accepts  →  moderator
 *   activates  →  the label appears on the homepage.
 */

/**
 * Waits for `main` to CONTAIN something, and returns whatever it last saw.
 *
 * Every read in this suite used to be `waitForTimeout(1200)` then read, which
 * passed on this laptop and failed on a loaded CI runner at the one step whose
 * page does two fetches — the thread list, then the thread. A fixed sleep is a
 * guess about somebody else's machine.
 *
 * Returns the text rather than throwing, so a genuine failure is still an
 * assertion with the page contents attached rather than an opaque timeout.
