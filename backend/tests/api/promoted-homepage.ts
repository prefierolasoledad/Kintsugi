/**
 * The homepage, reading live placements — and labelling them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
 * The label is the one part of this feature that is a legal requirement rather
 * than a product preference, and it is also the easiest thing in the whole
 * feature to lose silently: the flag travels from the placement table through
 * an endpoint, a fetch, a page, a shelf and a card, and any one of those
 * dropping it leaves a paid placement rendered as an editorial pick. Nothing
 * fails, no test goes red, and the page is deceptive.
 *
 * So this asserts against the SERVER-RENDERED HTML rather than against the
 * endpoint: the endpoint saying `promoted: true` proves nothing about what a
 * viewer sees.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0034-paid-homepage-placement.md

/**
 * Rendered labels, counted PER SURFACE.

 * Two earlier versions of this were too weak to notice a real regression, and
 * both failures are worth recording because they are the same mistake twice:
 *
 *   1. `/Promoted/` matched the word inside React's serialized props in the
 *      flight payload, so the count was non-zero with nothing promoted.
 *   2. `>Promoted<` counted the promoted ROW'S EYEBROW as well as the two
 *      labels, so "at least two" was satisfied by the hero plus the eyebrow —
 *      and the suite passed with the card's label deliberately disabled.
 *
 * So each occurrence is classified by the markup around it. Verified by
 * disabling the card label and watching `card` go to zero.
