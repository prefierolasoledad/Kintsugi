/**
 * SMS: consent, verification, and the gates before a message costs money.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
 * SMS is the channel where being wrong is most expensive — every send is
 * billed, arrives on a lock screen, and is regulated. So the claims worth
 * asserting are mostly about NOT sending:
 *
 *   1. Nothing is sent to a number nobody proved. `phoneVerifiedAt` is the
 *      gate, and an unverified number must be indistinguishable from no number.
 *   2. A six-digit code is single-use, expiring, and attempt-capped. Unlike a
 *      32-byte token it is genuinely guessable, so the caps ARE the security.
 *   3. `Address.phone` never leaks into `User.phone`. That is the trap ADR 0027
 *      exists to close, and the cost of getting it wrong is texting a stranger.
 *
 * Runs against SMS_PROVIDER=stub, which is the default. Nothing here reaches
 * Twilio, and no secret is needed — the same arrangement as the payment and
 * identity seams.
