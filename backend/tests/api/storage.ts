/**
 * The storage seam, on both drivers.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A LIBRARY SUITE
 * The property that matters is not "does an upload return 200" — it did that
 * while every image on the page was broken, which is the failure this phase
 * exists to fix. It is whether the bytes land somewhere a BROWSER can fetch
 * them from, which is a different address from the one the server writes to.
 *
 * The disk sections always run. The object-storage sections need MinIO:
 *
 *   docker compose up -d minio && docker compose up minio-init
 *   STORAGE_DRIVER=s3 S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000 \
 *     S3_ACCESS_KEY=kintsugi S3_SECRET_KEY=kintsugi-dev-secret \
 *     npm test -- storage
 *
 * See docs/adr/0022-object-storage-for-uploads.md
