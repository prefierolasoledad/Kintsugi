/**
 * A buyer asking for their money back.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
 * Until this existed a buyer had no route to a refund at all, while the footer
 * of every page promised them one. The eligibility rules are where that promise
 * either becomes true or becomes a way to take money out of the platform, and
 * every one of them fails expensively in a different direction:
 *
 *   1. Returning something that was never paid for — money nobody handed over.
 *   2. Returning something the seller never delivered.
 *   3. Returning something already refunded, which pays for it twice.
 *   4. Two requests on one line, answered separately.
 *   5. Two people answering one request, both winning.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS HAND-CHECKED. Every line is created for one purpose and named
 * for it, so a failure says which condition moved rather than that two numbers
 * disagree. See docs/adr/0031-buyer-initiated-returns.md
