 * Rate limiting, and what horizontal scaling does to it.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS
 * Most suites drive the API over HTTP. Several assertions here call the limiter
 * directly, because the properties that matter are not observable through a
 * response: whether a TTL was actually set, what happens when the shared store
 * is unreachable, and whether two callers can both slip past the same counter.
 *
 * The endpoint-level check is still here — a limiter nothing is wired to is a
 * library, not a control.

 * See docs/adr/0018-redis-for-shared-ephemeral-state.md
