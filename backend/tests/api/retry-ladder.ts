/**
 * The retry ladder.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
 * The ladder's whole job is to tell two failures apart and treat them
 * differently. Every claim below is one a happy path cannot reach:
 *
 *   1. A transient failure is RETRYABLE and a permanent one is not. Collapsing
 *      them passes every ordinary test and shows up as a bounced address being
 *      retried four times, which is how a sending domain gets blocked.
 *   2. A retry can RECLAIM its own failed ledger row. The unique constraint
 *      that makes redelivery safe (ADR 0026) also makes a retry look exactly
 *      like a duplicate — so without a deliberate reclaim the ladder is an
 *      elaborate no-op that silently delivers nothing.
 *   3. Reclaim is NARROW. Only a FAILED row, only when the retry path asks for
 *      it, and only one winner when two workers race. A reclaim that took over
 *      a PENDING row would send somebody's notification twice.
 *
 * NO BROKER FOR SECTIONS 1-3. The routing table is pure, and the reclaim
 * discipline is Postgres — both run against the real stack in about a second.
 * What genuinely needs a broker is in section 4, gated on KAFKA_BROKERS the
 * way the Redis sections of `cache` and `ratelimit` are gated on REDIS_URL,
 * and it SKIPS LOUDLY rather than passing quietly.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0025-kafka-topics-and-partitioning.md
