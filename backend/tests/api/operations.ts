/**
 * Phase 6: the parts that make this pipeline operable rather than merely
 * correct.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
 * Three claims, each of which is about a failure that is invisible until
 * somebody goes looking:
 *
 *   1. A `PENDING` row that nobody will ever settle is a LOST notification
 *      wearing a success. It is the ambiguous middle of ADR 0026, it went
 *      unbuilt through four phases, and the policy for resolving it
 *      deliberately differs per channel — so the SMS branch has to be asserted
 *      separately from the email one, because applying email's policy to SMS is
 *      exactly the mistake that costs money and trust.
 *   2. Retention must delete published rows and NEVER unpublished ones, at any
 *      age. An unpublished row is work still owed; deleting it destroys both
 *      the notification and the evidence.
 *   3. Lag must not report zero when nothing is consuming. The first version of
 *      `consumerLag` did exactly that — it iterated the group's committed
 *      offsets, which are an empty list for a group that has never run.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0026-delivery-idempotency.md
