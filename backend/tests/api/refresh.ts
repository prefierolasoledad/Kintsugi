/**
 * Refresh-token rotation: the race, and the theft it must not be confused with.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
 * Rotation with reuse detection had no direct coverage at all. The passwords
 * suite inspects token rows, and nothing drove /auth/refresh — so the single
 * most destructive behaviour in the auth system (one bad request revoking every
 * session a user has) was unasserted, and a grace window was about to be added
 * on top of it.
 *
 * THE THING BEING PROTECTED
 * Access tokens last fifteen minutes, so a page with several requests in flight
 * has them all expire at the same instant. Each retries with the same refresh
 * cookie, because it is the only one the browser has. Without a grace window
 * the first rotates it and the rest look like a replay — which revokes the
 * whole family and signs the user out of every device.
 *
 * THE THING THAT MUST STILL WORK
 * A genuine replay. Four of the sections below exist to prove the window did
 * not quietly become a hole: outside it, and for every kind of revocation that
 * is not a rotation, a reused token still destroys the family.
 *
 * Talks to the API directly, never the BFF — the BFF has a single-flight memo
 * that would dedupe the very race this is trying to provoke.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0021-refresh-race-grace-window.md
