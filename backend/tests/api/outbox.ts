/**
 * The outbox and the relay.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
 * Three claims that a response cannot show you, and that a passing happy path
 * would not catch:
 *
 *   1. The notification and its event commit TOGETHER or not at all. A dual
 *      write fails only on a crash in the gap between them, which no ordinary
 *      test reaches — so the gap is forced open here with a rollback.
 *   2. Two relays claim DISJOINT rows. `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and a plain
 *      `SELECT` look identical under no contention, and differ by exactly one
 *      duplicated email per concurrent pass under load.
 *   3. A publish that fails leaves the row UNPUBLISHED. Marking optimistically
 *      also passes every happy-path test, and loses notifications on the first
 *      broker blip.
 *
 * NO API AND NO BROKER. It drives lib/ directly against a real Postgres, so it
 * runs in about a second and is deterministic — no relay is ticking in this
 * process, so every pass happens exactly when this file says it does.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0024-outbox-not-dual-writes.md
