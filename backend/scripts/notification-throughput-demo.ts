/**
 * Measures what Kafka actually bought, and where it stops paying.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED
 * Plan 0001 §2 justifies a broker on three things, and the second is
 * "independent consumer scaling — SMS is slow and email is not; they should not
 * share a throughput budget". That is a performance claim, and this repository
 * measures performance rather than asserting it. So: N events through the real
 * email consumer group, at several consumer counts, reporting the lag
 * distribution and the throughput at each.
 *
 * AND WHERE IT STOPS. A consumer group cannot usefully run more consumers than
 * the topic has partitions — the extras are assigned nothing and idle. The main
 * topic has 12 partitions (ADR 0025), so consumer 13 does no work at all. That
 * is the unflattering half of the result and it is measured here rather than
 * left as a footnote.
 *
 * THE TOPIC IS PRE-LOADED BEFORE THE CLOCK STARTS, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
 * The relay is drained fully first, so every event is already on the broker
 * when the consumers start. The number this prints is therefore consumer-side
 * drain time, not end-to-end latency from the emitting call site — because the
 * thing being varied is consumers per group, and leaving the relay in the
 * measurement would mix its polling interval into every row.
 *
 * The relay's own publish rate is measured and printed separately, so the two
 * halves are both visible instead of being averaged into one misleading figure.
 *
 * HOW THE PARTITION CEILING IS PROVEN
 * Not from the throughput curve. On a machine with few cores, throughput
 * flattens because the consumers are contending for CPU, which looks identical
 * to flattening because they ran out of partitions — and concluding the latter
 * from the former would be exactly the kind of measurement this script exists
 * to avoid.
 *
 * Instead the broker is asked. `describeGroups` reports each member and the
 * partitions assigned to it, so "3 of 15 consumers were assigned nothing" is
 * the broker's own answer and is true regardless of how fast the hardware is.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/notification-throughput-demo.ts
 *   npx tsx scripts/notification-throughput-demo.ts --events 2000 --consumers 1,4
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS
 *   KAFKA_BROKERS      a reachable broker. There is nothing to measure without one.
 *   a compiled build   the consumers are `node dist/worker.js`, which is what
 *                      production runs. `npm run build` first.

 * members there are and not which partitions they hold — which is the only
 * part that matters here.
 *
 * So the broker's own CLI is asked instead, and its per-partition output is
 * read: every partition row names the CONSUMER-ID that owns it, and the number
 * of DISTINCT owners of main-topic partitions is the answer.
 *
 * AND WHY IT IS THE MAIN TOPIC SPECIFICALLY, WHICH IS THE SUBTLE PART.
 * Every worker subscribes to the main topic AND all three retry rungs, so the
 * group has 12 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30 partitions to hand out. A group can therefore
 * hold 30 members before anyone is completely idle — which means "12 is the
 * ceiling on consumers per group" is too loose a statement.
 *
 * What is true is narrower and is what this measures: past 12 members, some
 * hold NO main-topic partition, and those contribute nothing to the throughput
 * in this table however busy they look.
