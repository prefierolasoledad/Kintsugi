/**
 * The dead-letter queue: read it, and put messages back once the cause is fixed.
 *
 * AN OPERATOR TOOL, NOT A DEMO. Nothing here measures anything. It exists
 * because a DLQ nobody can drain is just a slower way of losing messages, and
 * the moment somebody needs it is the moment they are least willing to write a
 * one-off script against a broker.
 *
 * IT DOES NOTHING BY DEFAULT. Listing is safe and replaying is not, so the
 * default is a report and `--commit` is required to send anything. A tool whose
 * dangerous mode is the default gets used exactly once.
 *
 * WHY REPLAY GOES TO A RETRY RUNG AND NOT TO THE MAIN TOPIC
 * This is the part that is not obvious, and getting it wrong produces a replay
 * that appears to work and delivers nothing.
 *
 * Every message in the DLQ already has a ledger row, and that row is FAILED.
 * A message put back on the MAIN topic is claimed with `reclaim: false` — the
 * strict path — so it collides with that existing row, is read as an ordinary
 * redelivery, and is dropped. The logs would show the replay succeeding.
 *
 * A retry rung is consumed with `reclaim: true`, which is what allows a FAILED
 * row to be taken over and tried again. So that is where a replay belongs.
 * See deliveryLedger.claim().
 *
 * THE GROUP TAG IS PRESERVED. A DLQ entry belongs to whichever channel failed,
 * and replaying it untagged would hand it to every group — including the ones
 * that delivered it successfully the first time.
 *
