/**
 * Destroys a table, then gets it back. End to end, with the row counts printed.
 *
 *   docker compose --profile tools run --rm base-backup     # once, first
 *   npx tsx scripts/restore-drill.ts
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
 * A backup that has never been restored is not a backup, it is a hope.
 * Retention settings and a green "backup succeeded" line prove a file was
 * written; they say nothing about whether anything can be rebuilt from it. The
 * only evidence is a restore, and the only way a restore is trustworthy is if
 * it is boring — rehearsed often enough that nobody is improvising during an
 * incident.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES
 *   1. Creates a table and fills it with rows. Real, committed, archived.
 *   2. Notes the time, and forces the WAL segment holding all this into
 *      object storage.
 *   3. DROPS THE TABLE.
 *   4. Restores to the instant before the drop, into a second database.
 *   5. Counts the rows in both, and shows one has them and the other does not.
 *
 * ON ITS OWN TABLE, NOT `orders`
 * The mechanism does not care which table it is — recovery replays the whole
 * cluster to a moment, so dropping `orders` would be recovered identically.
 * A dedicated table means the drill is repeatable and leaves the database it
 * ran against untouched, which is what makes it something you run weekly
 * rather than once.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md
