/**
 * Proves the standby is a real standby, and measures how far behind it is.
 *
 *   docker compose --profile ha up -d postgres-replica
 *   npx tsx scripts/replication-demo.ts
 *
 * WHAT NEEDS PROVING
 * A second Postgres that starts without error is not a standby. It could be an
 * empty database that nobody is streaming to, and it would look identical from
 * the outside: healthy, accepting connections, answering queries. Four things
 * have to be true, and this checks each one rather than inferring it from the
 * absence of an error.
 *
 *   1. The replica is in recovery and the primary is not.
 *   2. The primary can see the replica streaming, by name.
 *   3. The replica refuses writes.
 *   4. A row committed on the primary appears on the replica, and how long
 *      that actually takes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 * A backup test. Replication copies `DROP TABLE orders` faithfully and in
 * milliseconds; that is it working correctly. Surviving a mistake needs
 * point-in-time recovery, which is separate.
 *
 * See docs/adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md
