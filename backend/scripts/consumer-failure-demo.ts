/**
 * Kills a consumer mid-batch and counts what that cost.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED
 * ADR 0026 says the pipeline is at-least-once with an idempotent ledger, and
 * that the two numbers which follow from that are both zero:
 *
 *   duplicate deliveries   0   the unique constraint refuses the second claim
 *   lost events            0   the offset was never committed, so it redelivers
 *
 * Those are the two halves of one trade. The worker commits its offset AFTER
 * the handler returns, so a consumer that dies between sending and committing
 * redelivers — a DUPLICATE rather than a LOSS. That is only survivable because
 * the ledger deduplicates, and this script is what shows both sides holding at
 * once rather than one being traded for the other.
 *
 * WHY SIGKILL AND NOT SIGTERM
 * SIGTERM is handled: the worker disconnects, leaves its group, and commits
 * what it finished. Nothing interesting happens. SIGKILL is the case the design
 * is actually defending against — a segfault, an OOM kill, a yanked cable — and
 * it is the one where an offset committed a moment too early loses somebody's
 * notification silently.
 *
 * HOW A DUPLICATE WOULD BE DETECTED
 * Not by trusting the constraint that is supposed to prevent it. The count is
 * `deliveries - distinct(eventId, channel)` over this run's rows: if the
 * constraint were dropped tomorrow this script would report the duplicates it
 * allows, rather than reporting zero because a unique index made the query
 * impossible to fail.
