# Kills the Postgres primary and counts what that cost.
#
# WHAT IS BEING CLAIMED
# ADR 0020 built physical replication in Compose and said plainly that nothing
# there promotes a standby. ADR 0032 replaced it with a CloudNativePG Cluster.
# The claim is that two numbers hold:
#
#   requests lost after recovery   0   the -rw Service follows the new primary
#   API restarts needed            0   Prisma's pool reconnects on its own
#
# Those are the two halves of one trade. A pool that cached the old primary's
# address would need a restart, and a restart is a thing an orchestrator can do
# for you — which would make this demo pass while hiding the interesting part.
# So the restart count is measured, not assumed.
#
# WHY DELETING THE POD IS A FAIR TEST
# It is not a clean switchover: `cnpg promote` would ask the operator to move
# the primary in an orderly way, which is not what a dead node does. Deleting
# the pod leaves the PVC behind, so the instance tries to come back and fails,
# and the operator has to decide to promote the other one. That is the case the
# design is defending against.
#
# HOW A LOST WRITE WOULD BE DETECTED
# Not by watching the storefront return 200 — a cached page does that with no
# database at all. A row is INSERTed through the BFF after failover and then
# read back out of the new primary by name.
#
#   ./k8s/failover-demo.sh
#
# See docs/adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md and docs/adr/0032-kubernetes-manifests.md
