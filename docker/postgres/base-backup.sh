# Takes a base backup and puts it in object storage.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM WAL ARCHIVING
# The archive is a stream of changes, and a stream of changes restores nothing
# on its own — recovery replays WAL *onto* a copy of the database. So
# point-in-time recovery needs both, and the oldest recoverable moment is the
# oldest base backup you still have, not the oldest WAL segment.
#
# Run on demand, or on a schedule:
#   docker compose run --rm base-backup
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT
# A retention policy, an incremental backup, or a verification pass. pgBackRest
# and barman do all three; this does the one thing that makes recovery possible
# and says so. In Kubernetes it is replaced by CloudNativePG's
# `barmanObjectStore`, which schedules, retains and verifies properly.
#
# See docs/adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md

# `stream` would embed the WAL needed to make this backup self-consistent, which
# is right for a standalone copy. Here the archive already has every segment, and
# recovery reads from the archive — so embedding it would store the same bytes
# twice and, worse, invite the belief that the base backup alone is enough.
#
# The trade is that this backup is NOT restorable without the archive. That is
# the correct coupling for PITR and the wrong one for a single-file export.
