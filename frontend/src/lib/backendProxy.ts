 *
 * The admin endpoints break that assumption. A wrong password or code at
 * step-up is a 401 about the CREDENTIALS, and no amount of refreshing changes
 * the answer. Retrying it silently sent the whole attempt twice, which spent
 * two of the eight allowed tries per fifteen minutes for one wrong code — so
 * the real budget was four, and a moderator could lock themselves out in half
 * the attempts the limit advertises. It also ran bcrypt and TOTP verification
 * twice for every failure.
 *
 * ADMIN_SESSION_REQUIRED is the same story and far more common: it is the
 * ordinary answer to "is an admin session live?", which the panel asks on every
 * page load. Each of those was triggering a pointless refresh — and a refresh
 * rotates the refresh token, so a page load was needlessly churning the token
 * family that theft detection watches.
