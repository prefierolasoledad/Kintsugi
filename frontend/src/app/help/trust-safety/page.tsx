      <h2>Listings are checked, not just posted</h2>
      <p>
        Photos and descriptions are reviewed before a listing goes live. It's not
        a guarantee against every possible misrepresentation, but it catches the
        obvious ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Payment is held, not handed over</h2>
      <p>
        A buyer's payment sits in escrow until they confirm the item arrived as
        described. Sellers aren't paid up front, and buyers aren't paying into a
        void — see{" "}
        <a href="/sell/payouts" className="text-gold-dim underline">
          payouts
        </a>{" "}
        for the exact timing.
      </p>

      <h2>Everything ships — no in-person meetups</h2>
      <p>
        There's no option to arrange a local pickup or cash handoff. Every
        transaction goes through the platform, with tracking and a return
        window, on purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Reporting a problem</h2>
      <p>
        If a listing looks off — stolen goods, counterfeit items, a seller asking
        to take payment outside the platform — report it from the listing page
        or{" "}
        <a href="/help/contact" className="text-gold-dim underline">
          contact us
        </a>{" "}
        directly. Reports are reviewed by a person, not just auto-closed.
      </p>
