 * What a seller is actually charged, which is nothing.

 * This page used to advertise an 8% marketplace commission and worked through
 * an example ending in $88.80 on a $100 sale. No code ever deducted it: a
 * payout transfers the full line total, and the whole argument in ADR 0029 for
 * separate transfers rather than destination charges rests on the platform
 * taking no cut. So the page and the money disagreed by $8 on every sale, and
 * a seller could read the fees page and their payouts page and get two
 * different answers about the same item.
 *
 * Corrected to describe what the system does. The open question — who pays the
 * provider's fees on a platform with no revenue — is recorded in plan 0002
 * rather than answered with an invented number.

      <h2>What&apos;s deducted at sale</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing. Sell something for $100 and you are paid <strong>$100</strong>.
        There is no marketplace commission, and the payment processor&apos;s fee
        is not passed on to you either — Kintsugi absorbs it.

        Your{" "}
        <a href="/seller/payouts" className="text-gold-dim underline">
          payouts page
        </a>{" "}
        lists every item waiting alongside the exact amount you&apos;ll receive
        for it, so the figure is never a total you have to take on trust.
      </p>

      <h2>What&apos;s free</h2>
      <p>
        Listing an item costs nothing, whether it sells or not. Relisting an
        expired listing is also free.
      </p>

      <h2>Why there&apos;s no cut</h2>
      <p>
        Kintsugi exists to get repaired things back into use, and a commission
        on a $40 mended bowl is the kind of friction that stops people bothering.
        It also means there is no revenue behind the payment fees — which is a
        real constraint, openly recorded rather than papered over, and one that
        would have to be revisited before this ran at any scale.
      </p>

      <h2>When you get paid</h2>
      <p>
        After the buyer confirms delivery and the return window closes. See{" "}
        <a href="/sell/payouts" className="text-gold-dim underline">
          payouts
        </a>{" "}
