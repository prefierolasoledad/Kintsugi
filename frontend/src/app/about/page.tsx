                Kintsugi is the Japanese practice of mending broken pottery with
                gold, so the seam becomes the most visible part of the object
                rather than the part you apologise for.

                That is the whole idea behind this shop. Everything sold here has
                been owned before, and most of it carries some mark of that — a
                water ring, a resoled boot, a crack that was repaired years ago and
                has held ever since. We would rather name those things than
                photograph around them.

                Anyone can list here. Sellers set their own prices and write their
                own descriptions, and the account you browse with is the account you
                sell from — there is no separate seller sign-up to complete.
              </p>
              <p className="text-ink-dim">
                Almost everything is one of one. That changes how buying works: an
                item you are looking at is held for you while you decide, so two
                people cannot end up owning the same chair.

                Verifying your identity is only needed before money is paid out to
                you. Listing an item never requires it, because a listing is not a
                transaction.

              Every listing carries one of four condition grades, so you can filter

              the line you see on the card, because &ldquo;Needs a tune-up&rdquo; tells
              you more than any fixed vocabulary can.

                Checkout runs against a payment sandbox. You can browse, hold an
                item so nobody else takes it, list things of your own, and go all
                the way through paying — but the card is a test card, no real money
                has ever moved through this site, and nothing gets shipped.
