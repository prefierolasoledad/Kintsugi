# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Every image this project ships, from one file.
#
#   docker build --target api       .   the Express API
#   docker build --target web       .   the Next storefront (which is the BFF)
#   docker build --target api-build .   migrations and seeding (has the CLI)
#
# docker-compose.yml selects these with `target:`; the Kubernetes manifests use
# `api` and `web`.
#
# WHY ONE FILE AND NOT TWO
# There were three: backend/Dockerfile, frontend/Dockerfile, and briefly an
# all-in-one that re-implemented both. The shared parts had already drifted
# apart once — the dependency prune below is thirteen paths that have to stay
# identical in every image, and it was living in two places, either of which
# could silently regain 204MB.
#
# An all-in-one target briefly lived here too, running both processes under a
# supervisor. It was removed: it was the one target nothing depended on, and it
# put a second, mutually exclusive way to run the app beside the real one. See
# ADR 0023.
#
# WHY DEBIAN SLIM AND NOT ALPINE
# `sharp` is a production dependency — every seller photo is re-encoded through
# it to strip EXIF (ADR 0010). It ships prebuilt binaries per platform, and the
# musl builds Alpine needs are the single most common source of "works locally,
# segfaults in the container". Roughly 70MB of image is a fair price for
# removing a class of failure that only appears at runtime.
#
# Prisma helps here: this project uses driver adapters (@prisma/adapter-pg), so
# there is no native query engine to match against the base image at all.
#
# See docs/adr/0023-one-dockerfile-many-targets.md

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Production dependencies, and the one thing about them that is not obvious.
#
# `--omit=dev` IS NOT ENOUGH. `@prisma/client` declares the Prisma CLI and
# TypeScript as OPTIONAL PEER dependencies:
#
#   peerDependencies:     { "prisma": "*", "typescript": ">=5.4.0" }
#   peerDependenciesMeta: { "prisma": {"optional": true}, ... }
#
# npm installs optional peers anyway and marks them `devOptional` in the
# lockfile — reachable both as a devDependency and as an optional peer — so
# `--omit=dev` keeps them. A "production" tree therefore carried the CLI, the
# TypeScript compiler, and Prisma Studio's entire React UI. Measured: 204MB of
# 470MB.
#
# `--omit=optional` drops them and also drops `@img/sharp-linux-x64`, so image
# processing throws on the first upload — measured, not guessed. It removes
# about ninety other packages too, any of which might be needed on a path the
# tests do not reach. Rejected as a blunt instrument.
#
# So: delete exactly what the CLI drags in. Every entry below was traced with
# `npm ls` to one of `prisma`, `@prisma/config`, `@prisma/dev` or
# `@prisma/studio-core`; none of them is reachable from `@prisma/client`'s
# runtime.
#
# IN THE SAME `RUN` AS THE INSTALL, deliberately. Layers are additive, so
# deleting in a later step removes the files from the filesystem and leaves them
# in the image — making it bigger, not smaller.
#
# The `node -e` at the end is a build-time assertion: if this prune ever goes
# too far, the build fails here rather than the first upload failing in
# production.
