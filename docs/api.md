# API Reference

Express API, default `http://localhost:4000`.

The browser does not call these directly. It calls the matching BFF path under
`/api/*` on the Next.js server, which forwards them
([ADR 0002](adr/0002-bff-proxy.md)). `POST /auth/login` in this document is
`POST /api/auth/login` from the browser.

---

## Conventions

**Auth.** Session state travels in two `httpOnly` cookies. Requests marked
🔒 need a valid access token; 🏪 additionally requires a seller profile;
👮 requires a *separate* short-lived admin session obtained by step-up, which
the ordinary login cookie does not grant — see [Admin](#admin--admin-).

**Errors.** Consistent JSON:

```json
{ "error": "Human-readable message.", "code": "MACHINE_CODE", "field": "priceCents" }
```

`field` appears when one input is at fault, so the UI can render the message
against that input. `code` is stable; `error` text is not.

| Status | Meaning here |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Validation failed |
| 401 | No or expired session |
| 403 | Authenticated but not permitted (`NOT_A_SELLER`, `PAYOUTS_LOCKED`) |
| 404 | Not found — **also returned for records owned by someone else** |
| 409 | Conflict with current state (`ALREADY_VERIFIED`, `SESSION_CLOSED`) |
| 429 | Rate limited; includes `retryAfterSeconds` |
| 500 | Server error; details are logged, not returned |

**Money** is integer minor units (`priceCents`) in bodies. The one exception is
`/catalog/listings`, whose `minPrice`/`maxPrice` are whole currency units
because that is what a price filter collects.

---

## Health

### `GET /health`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "service": "kintsugi-backend" }
```

### `GET /health/lag`

Is anyone actually *receiving* notifications. Separate from `/health` because it
talks to a broker over the network, and a load balancer's liveness probe must
not depend on that.

**503 when unhealthy**, so a monitor does not have to parse a body to know.

```json
{
  "transport": "kafka",
  "healthy": true,
  "groups": [
    { "group": "email-worker", "lag": 0, "byTopic": {}, "uncommitted": 0 },
    { "group": "sms-worker", "lag": 140, "byTopic": { "kintsugi.notifications.v1": 140 }, "uncommitted": 30 }
  ],
  "dlqDepth": 0,
  "thresholds": { "lag": 5000, "dlq": 100 }
}
```

Lag covers **every rung of the retry ladder**, not just the main topic: a group
stalled on `retry.15m` is a real failure that main-topic lag reports as zero.

`uncommitted` is partitions the group has never committed. Their whole retained
backlog is counted in `lag` — because that is what the group still owes — but
the count is separate so "never started" stays distinguishable from "fallen
behind", which matters for the few seconds after a deploy.

On the inline transport it answers `{ "transport": "inline", "healthy": true,
"detail": … }`. **It does not alert.** There is no alerting stack here, and the
thresholds are returned so that whatever does alert need not encode them.

---

## Auth — `/auth`

### `POST /auth/signup`

```json
{ "name": "Ada Lovelace", "email": "ada@example.com", "password": "at least 12 chars" }
```

Password must be ≥ 12 characters and is checked against Pwned Passwords
([ADR 0004](adr/0004-password-policy.md)). No session is created — the account
must be verified first.

`201` → `{ "message": "...", "email": "ada@example.com" }`

| Failure | Code | `field` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password too short | `INVALID_INPUT` | `password` |
| Password found in breach corpora | `PASSWORD_BREACHED` | `password` |
| Email already registered **and verified** | `EMAIL_IN_USE` | `email` |

Signing up again on an *unverified* email is not an error: it re-sends the link
and updates the stored password hash.

> Delivery is controlled by `MAIL_TRANSPORT` (nodemailer):
> `console` (default) prints the link to the backend terminal and sends nothing;
> `ethereal` really sends to a throwaway inbox and logs a URL where the rendered
> message can be read; `smtp` uses a real server and the process refuses to
> start unless `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, and `SMTP_PASS` are all set.
>
> A send failure does **not** fail the signup — the account and token are already
> committed, so a transient SMTP error would otherwise 500 an account that
> exists. It is logged loudly instead, and the recovery path is
> `POST /auth/resend-verification`.

### `POST /auth/verify-email`

```json
{ "token": "<from the emailed link>" }
```

Single-use, 24-hour expiry. `200` → `{ "user": { ... } }` and a session is
established.

### `POST /auth/resend-verification`

```json
{ "email": "ada@example.com" }
```

Always `200` — it does not reveal whether the address is registered.

### `POST /auth/login`

```json
{ "email": "ada@example.com", "password": "..." }
```

`200` → `{ "user": { ... } }`, sets both cookies.

| Status | Failure | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | Wrong email or password | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` |
| 403 | Account suspended | `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` |
| 403 | Email not verified | `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` |
| 429 | Too many attempts for this address | `RATE_LIMITED` |

Login is hard-blocked until verified — no partial session.

**Rate limited to 10 attempts per 15 minutes per address**, and the counter is
cleared the moment a correct password is given, so ordinary mistyping never
accumulates. The 429 carries `retryAfterSeconds`.

The counter is keyed on the submitted address rather than on a user row, so an
address with no account throttles identically — a 429 says nothing about whether
the account exists. Same reason the 401 uses one message for a wrong address and
a wrong password.

There is deliberately **no per-IP limit** on this endpoint, unlike
`/auth/password/forgot`. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#known-gaps) for why,
and for the denial-of-service the per-address limit knowingly accepts.

### `POST /auth/refresh`

Rotates the refresh token and issues a new access token. `204` with new
cookies.

Presenting an already-rotated token revokes the entire token family: reuse
means the credential leaked. → [ADR 0001](adr/0001-access-and-refresh-tokens.md)

**With one exception, for the ten seconds after rotation.** Access tokens expire
in batches, so several requests routinely retry with the same refresh cookie —
the only one the browser has. A token superseded that recently gets a new access
token and **no new refresh cookie**, leaving the one the winning request already
set. Rotation itself is an atomic claim, so exactly one of N concurrent requests
rotates however many arrive together.

Tokens revoked by logout or a password change are never graced, and outside the
window a replay still revokes everything.
→ [ADR 0021](adr/0021-refresh-race-grace-window.md)

### `POST /auth/password/change` 🔒

```json
{ "currentPassword": "...", "newPassword": "at least 12 chars" }
```

The current password is required **even though the caller is authenticated**.
A stolen session must not be enough to take the account permanently.

Revokes every **other** refresh token — the calling tab stays signed in, because
signing you out for good security hygiene is hostile. Outstanding reset links
are burned too, so a compromise-driven change does not leave a working link in
an inbox somebody else may be reading.

`200` → `{ "ok": true, "otherSessionsEnded": 2, "message": "..." }`

| Failure | Code | `field` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current password wrong | `WRONG_PASSWORD` (401) | `currentPassword` |
| Under 12 characters | `INVALID_INPUT` | `newPassword` |
| Same as the current one | `SAME_PASSWORD` | `newPassword` |
| Found in breach corpora | `PASSWORD_BREACHED` | `newPassword` |

Rate limited to 10 per 15 minutes — the current-password check is a password
oracle for anyone holding a stolen session and guessing.

### `POST /auth/password/forgot`

```json
{ "email": "ada@example.com" }
```

**Always `200`, with an identical body**, whether the address is registered,
unregistered, or malformed — and identical again when rate limited. Anything
else makes this an account-enumeration oracle, and the list it produces is
exactly what a credential-stuffing run wants.

Rate limited **per address** (3/hour, so the endpoint cannot be used to flood
somebody's inbox) **and per caller** (20/hour, so one caller cannot do that to a
long list of addresses). Neither limit changes the response.

Asking again invalidates any previous unused link: two live links means the
older one — the more likely to have leaked — still works.

### `POST /auth/password/reset`

```json
{ "token": "<from the emailed link>", "newPassword": "at least 12 chars" }
```

Single-use, **one hour**. A verification link only proves an inbox exists; a
reset link *is* the account until it is used, which is why it does not get the
24 hours verification does. Only the hash is stored.

Unknown, expired and already-used tokens all return the **same**
`INVALID_TOKEN` message. Saying "expired" would confirm the token was real.

Rate limited to 100/hour per caller — a courtesy cap rather than a guessing
control. The token is 256 bits, so the endpoint cannot be brute forced at any
limit, and an invalid one costs a hash plus an indexed lookup and returns before
any bcrypt or breach-list call. A tighter cap would mostly punish shared egress
addresses.

Revokes **every** session — there is none to preserve, and if the account was
taken over then the intruder's is among them. Also sets `emailVerified`:
redeeming the link proves inbox control, which is what verification asks, so an
unverified account is not left locked out for a reason it has already satisfied.

**No session is issued.** The response sends you to sign in with the password
you just chose. Doing otherwise would make a reset link a one-click login, and
links leak — forwarded mail, shared screens, scanners that follow URLs.

> A reset deliberately does **not** clear an admin's TOTP enrolment. Mail access
> must not strip a second factor, since the inbox is precisely where the reset
> link lands.

### `POST /auth/logout`

Revokes the refresh token and clears cookies. `204`.

### `GET /auth/me` 🔒

```json
{ "user": { "id": "…", "name": "Ada Lovelace", "email": "ada@example.com",
            "isSeller": false, "emailVerified": true, "createdAt": "…" } }
```

### `POST /auth/become-seller` 🔒

Sets `isSeller` and creates the `SellerProfile` in one transaction. Idempotent.
`200` → `{ "user": { ... } }`

---

## Profile — `/profile` 🔒

### `POST /profile/avatar`

`multipart/form-data`, field name `avatar`. JPEG, PNG, or WebP; max 5 MB; 10
uploads per user per hour.

Validated by **magic bytes**, cropped to a 512×512 square, and re-encoded to
WebP — which strips EXIF including GPS. The image is written to object storage
and only its URL is stored on the user row
([ADR 0011](adr/0011-avatars-in-object-storage.md)).

Replacing an existing picture deletes the previous object, but only after the
new URL is committed — so a failed write never leaves an account with no
picture.

`200` → `{ "user": { ..., "avatarUrl": "https://…/uploads/<key>.webp" } }`

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Not a real image | `INVALID_IMAGE` |
| Over 5 MB / unreadable upload | `UPLOAD_FAILED` |
| Nothing attached | `NO_FILE` |
| Hourly cap hit | `RATE_LIMITED` |

### `DELETE /profile/avatar`

Clears `avatarUrl` and deletes the stored object. The UI falls back to generated
initials.

`200` → `{ "user": { ..., "avatarUrl": null } }`

---

## Catalog — `/catalog` (public)

Only listings with `status = ACTIVE` and `deletedAt IS NULL` are ever returned.

### `GET /catalog/categories`

```json
{ "categories": [
  { "id": "…", "slug": "furniture-home", "title": "Furniture & Home",
    "description": "…", "coverImage": "https://…", "listingCount": 3 }
] }
```

`listingCount` counts visible listings only.

### `GET /catalog/listings`

| Param | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string | Case-insensitive substring of title or description |
| `category` | slug | |
| `condition` | enum | `LIKE_NEW` \| `GOOD` \| `WELL_LOVED` \| `NEEDS_REPAIR` |
| `minPrice`, `maxPrice` | number | **Whole currency units** |
| `featured` | `true` \| `false` | |
| `sort` | enum | `newest` (default), `price_asc`, `price_desc` |
| `page` | int | Default 1 |
| `limit` | int | Default 24, max 48 |

Empty-string params are treated as absent, so an untouched filter form is a
valid request.

```json
{
  "listings": [ { /* listing */ } ],
  "total": 13, "page": 1, "limit": 24, "pageCount": 1
}
```

Listing object:

```json
{
  "id": "…", "slug": "brown-leather-jacket",
  "title": "Brown leather jacket", "description": "…",
  "condition": "LIKE_NEW", "conditionNote": "Like new",
  "priceCents": 12000, "originalPriceCents": 15000, "currency": "USD",
  "quantity": 1, "featured": false, "createdAt": "2026-08-19T…",
  "category": { "slug": "clothing-accessories", "title": "Clothing & Accessories" },
  "seller":   { "shopName": "Kintsugi Collection", "verified": true },
  "images":   [ { "url": "https://…", "alt": "…", "position": 0 } ],
  "rating":   { "average": 4.8, "count": 5 }
}
```

`rating.average` is `null` when there are no reviews — not `0`.
`seller.verified` is derived from KYC status and exposes no verification detail.

`400 INVALID_PRICE_RANGE` when `minPrice > maxPrice`.

### `GET /catalog/listings/:slug`

Adds `reviews` to the listing (newest 20) and a sibling `related` array (up to
4 from the same category).

```json
{
  "listing": { "…": "…", "reviews": [
    { "id": "…", "rating": 5, "body": "…", "createdAt": "…", "authorName": "Noah Brenner" }
  ] },
  "related": [ { /* listing */ } ]
}
```

`404 NOT_FOUND` if the slug is unknown, unpublished, or soft-deleted.

---

## Reservations — `/reservations` 🔒

A short-lived hold on stock, taken before checkout exists to convert it. This is
where the oversell race is prevented: availability is decided inside a
transaction holding `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the listing row, so two buyers can
never both claim the same unique item.
→ [ADR 0012](adr/0012-row-locking-for-reservations.md)

### `GET /reservations`

Your live holds, newest first, plus `holdMinutes` (currently 15).

### `POST /reservations`

```json
{ "listingId": "<id>", "quantity": 1 }
```

`201` → `{ "reservation": { "id", "listingId", "quantity", "expiresAt", "remainingQuantity" } }`

Stock is decremented and the listing flips to `RESERVED` once it reaches zero —
distinct from `SOLD`, because no money has moved.

| Failure | Code | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nothing left | `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` | 409 |
| Sold, draft, or removed | `UNAVAILABLE` | 409 |
| You already hold it | `ALREADY_HELD` | 409 |
| It's your own listing | `OWN_LISTING` | 400 |
| Unknown listing | `NOT_FOUND` | 404 |

**Losing a race is a 409, not a 500.** Contention is an expected outcome.

### `DELETE /reservations/:id`

Releases the hold and returns the stock, flipping the listing back to `ACTIVE`.
`204`.

Holds also expire on their own after 15 minutes, and expired stock is reclaimed
lazily the next time someone tries to reserve that listing — so correctness
doesn't depend on a background job.

---

## Seller — `/seller` 🔒🏪

Non-sellers receive `403 NOT_A_SELLER`.

Every route is scoped to the caller's own records. **A listing owned by another
seller returns 404, not 403** — a 403 would confirm the id exists.

### `GET /seller/me`

```json
{ "seller": { "id": "…", "shopName": "…", "bio": null,
              "kycStatus": "UNSTARTED", "payoutsEnabled": false, "createdAt": "…" },
  "counts": { "DRAFT": 2, "ACTIVE": 5 } }
```

### `GET /seller/listings`

All of the caller's listings, any status, newest-updated first. Excludes
soft-deleted.

### `GET /seller/listings/:id`

### `POST /seller/listings`

```json
{
  "title": "Walnut side table",
  "description": "At least 10 characters.",
  "categoryId": "<uuid>",
  "condition": "GOOD",
  "conditionNote": "Water ring",
  "priceCents": 8500,
  "originalPriceCents": 11000,
  "quantity": 1,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

Constraints: `title` 3–120, `description` 10–4000, `conditionNote` ≤ 60,
`priceCents` ≥ 1, `quantity` 1–999, and `originalPriceCents` must exceed
`priceCents`.

Created as `DRAFT`. `slug` is derived from the title and fixed thereafter.

`201` → `{ "listing": { ... } }`

### `PATCH /seller/listings/:id`

Accepts any subset of the create body. The `slug` is **not** regenerated when
the title changes. `409 LISTING_SOLD` if the listing is sold.

### `POST /seller/listings/:id/publish`

`DRAFT` → `ACTIVE`.

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| No photos | `NEEDS_PHOTO` |
| Already sold | `LISTING_SOLD` |

Deliberately **not** gated on identity verification
([ADR 0007](adr/0007-verification-gates-payouts.md)).

### `POST /seller/listings/:id/unpublish`

`ACTIVE` → `DRAFT`.

### `DELETE /seller/listings/:id`

Soft delete: sets `deletedAt` and `status = REMOVED`. `204`.

### `POST /seller/listings/:id/images`

`multipart/form-data`, field name `image`. JPEG, PNG, or WebP; max 8 MB; max 8
images per listing; 30 uploads per user per hour.

The file is validated by **magic bytes** (not extension or `Content-Type`) and
re-encoded to WebP, which strips EXIF including GPS.

`201` → `{ "image": { "id": "…", "url": "…", "alt": "…", "position": 0 } }`

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Not a real image | `INVALID_IMAGE` |
| Over 8 MB / unreadable upload | `UPLOAD_FAILED` |
| Nothing attached | `NO_FILE` |
| Already 8 images | `TOO_MANY_IMAGES` |
| Hourly cap hit | `RATE_LIMITED` |

### `DELETE /seller/listings/:id/images/:imageId`

`204`. Returns `400 NEEDS_PHOTO` when removing the only photo of a published
listing.

---

## Verification & payouts — `/seller` 🔒🏪

### `GET /seller/verification`

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "status": "REJECTED", "provider": "stub",
    "documentType": "drivers_license", "country": "GB",
    "verifiedAt": null,
    "rejectionReason": "The document image couldn't be read clearly.",
    "payoutsEnabled": false,
    "isStub": true
  },
  "attempts": [ { "id": "…", "provider": "stub", "providerSessionId": "…",
                  "status": "REJECTED", "documentType": "drivers_license",
                  "country": "GB", "rejectionReason": "…",
                  "createdAt": "…", "completedAt": "…" } ]
}
```

`isStub` is exposed so the UI can say no real check occurred. Up to 10 attempts
are returned, newest first.

### `POST /seller/verification`

Starts a session, or resumes an in-flight one rather than creating a duplicate.
Max 5 per hour.

`201` → `{ "session": { "providerSessionId": "…", "redirectUrl": "…" }, "resumed": false }`
`200` → same shape with `"resumed": true` when an open session already exists.

`409 ALREADY_VERIFIED` once verified.

### `POST /seller/verification/:sessionId/submit`

```json
{ "documentType": "passport", "country": "US", "documentNumber": "…" }
```

`documentType` ∈ `passport` | `drivers_license` | `national_id`; `country` is a
2-letter code (normalised to uppercase); `documentNumber` is 6–40 characters.

> **`documentNumber` is never stored.** It is evaluated and discarded — not
> persisted, not logged, not returned.
> → [ADR 0006](adr/0006-kyc-store-reference-not-document.md)

Stub outcomes: number ending `0000` → rejected (unreadable), `0001` → rejected
(name mismatch), anything else → verified.

`200` → `{ "outcome": "VERIFIED", "rejectionReason": null, "payoutsEnabled": true }`

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown session, or another seller's | `NOT_FOUND` (404) |
| Session already resolved | `SESSION_CLOSED` (409) |

With a real provider this transition would arrive as a signature-verified
webhook rather than a client submission.

### `GET /seller/payouts`

`403 PAYOUTS_LOCKED` (with `kycStatus`) until verified. This is the payout gate,
enforced server-side rather than only in the UI.

Once verified:

```json
{ "payouts": { "enabled": true, "balanceCents": 0, "currency": "USD",
               "history": [],
               "note": "Payments are sandbox only and payouts aren't built, so there's nothing to pay out." } }
```

The zero balance is honest, not a placeholder. Checkout exists, but it runs
against a payment sandbox and there is no payout pipeline, so no real money has
moved.

---

## Addresses — `/addresses` 🔒

Where orders get delivered. Checkout requires one.

Deleted entries are soft-deleted, and **past orders never reference these rows at
all** — an order copies the fields onto itself at checkout. Editing or deleting
an address must not change where a past parcel was sent.

### `GET /addresses`
Your addresses, default first then newest.

### `POST /addresses`
```json
{ "fullName": "…", "line1": "…", "line2": null, "city": "…",
  "region": null, "postcode": "…", "country": "GB", "phone": null,
  "isDefault": false }
```
`country` is ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. Everything else is deliberately loose —
address formats differ enough between countries that strict validation rejects
more real addresses than it catches bad ones.

The **first** address saved becomes the default whether or not `isDefault` was
sent, so checkout always has something to preselect.

`409 TOO_MANY` past 20 addresses.

### `PATCH /addresses/:id` · `DELETE /addresses/:id`
Scoped to the owner; someone else's address is a **404, not a 403**.
Deleting the default promotes the next most recent, rather than leaving a buyer
with addresses but no default.

### `POST /addresses/:id/default`
Exactly one default at a time, swapped inside a transaction.

---

## Orders — `/orders` 🔒

→ [ADR 0013](adr/0013-payment-provider-seam.md)

### `POST /orders`
Converts live holds into an order and opens a payment intent.

```json
{ "addressId": "uuid" }   // optional — omitted means "use my default"
```

`400 NO_ADDRESS` if the buyer has none. The UI treats this as a missing step and
routes to the address form rather than showing an error.

The response order carries `shipTo` — the address **as it was that day**.

### `GET /orders` · `GET /orders/:id`
Scoped to the buyer. Someone else's order is a 404.

Each item carries its own `fulfilment`, `carrier`, `trackingNumber`,
`shippedAt`, `deliveredAt`, and `fulfilmentNote`. Fulfilment is per line because
a basket can span several sellers, and two sellers cannot share one parcel —
so "your order has shipped" is not something that can honestly be said about a
whole order.

### `POST /orders/:id/pay`
```json
{ "cardNumber": "4242424242424242" }
```
Claims the order atomically before contacting the provider. Concurrent calls get
`409 PAYMENT_IN_PROGRESS` or `409 ALREADY_PAID` — never a second charge.

### `GET /orders/refunds` 🔒

Every refund this buyer has received, newest first (max 100).

```json
{ "refunds": [ {
  "id": "…", "amountCents": 3200, "currency": "USD",
  "status": "SUCCEEDED", "trigger": "SELLER_UNFULFILLABLE",
  "reason": "Cracked while I was packing it.",
  "createdAt": "…", "completedAt": "…",
  "orderId": "…", "orderReference": "KIN-W9ABBM",
  "itemTitle": "Cast iron skillet"
} ] }
```

Declared **before** `/:id` in the router — Express matches in order, so swapped
it would read as an order whose id is the string `refunds`.

`itemTitle` comes from the line's snapshot, so it survives the listing being
deleted — a likely outcome for something a seller could not send.

### `POST /orders/:id/cancel`
Only while `PENDING_PAYMENT`. A `PROCESSING` order returns
`409 PAYMENT_IN_PROGRESS`, because returning stock while a charge may complete
risks selling an item someone has paid for.

### `POST /orders/items/:itemId/delivered`
The **buyer** confirms arrival. Deliberately not the seller's call: a seller
marking their own parcel delivered is not evidence of anything, and once payouts
exist this confirmation is what releasing money would hang on. Idempotent.

---

## Sales — `/seller/sales` 🔒🏪

What a seller has sold. Previously impossible to ask: order lines carried a
`sellerName` *string* and nothing queryable, so a seller could never see their
own orders.

### `GET /seller/sales?filter=all|to_send|sent`

Only `PAID` orders appear. An unpaid checkout is never shown — sellers should
not pack parcels for carts that get abandoned, and the buyer's address is
released at the same moment, not before.

```json
{ "sales": [ { "id": "…", "title": "…", "order": { "reference": "KIN-…" },
              "fulfilment": "UNFULFILLED", "shipTo": { "line1": "…" } } ],
  "summary": { "toSend": 1, "shipped": 0, "delivered": 0, "grossCents": 4200 } }
```

`grossCents` is named gross on purpose: there is no payout pipeline, so calling
it earnings would imply money is waiting somewhere.

### `POST /seller/sales/:id/ship`
```json
{ "carrier": "Royal Mail", "trackingNumber": "RM…" }
```
Both optional — plenty of secondhand sales are handed over in person or posted
without a trackable service, and demanding a number pushes sellers into
inventing one. Idempotent: shipping twice updates the tracking rather than
erroring.

### `POST /seller/sales/:id/cannot-send`
```json
{ "reason": "Broke while I was packing it, sorry." }
```
Refunds that line automatically, for exactly what was paid for it — not the
whole order, since a basket can span sellers and one seller failing to post says
nothing about the others. The refund is attributed to the seller rather than to
a moderator, carries their stated reason, and notifies the buyer that the money
is on its way back. See [ADR 0016](adr/0016-refunds-claim-then-refund.md).

## Wishlist — `/wishlist` 🔒

Saving is **inert**: it never reserves, hides, or changes what anyone else sees.
Two people can save the same one-of-a-kind chair and neither has claimed it.

- `GET /wishlist` — full entries. Sold items stay on the list, flagged `sold`,
  rather than vanishing.
- `GET /wishlist/ids` — ids only, for drawing a grid of hearts in one request.
- `PUT /wishlist/:listingId` — idempotent, via a unique index on
  `(userId, listingId)`. Six simultaneous saves produce one row.
- `DELETE /wishlist/:listingId` — removing something not saved is a success, not
  a 404.

---

## Reviews — `/reviews` 🔒

A review requires a **PAID order for that listing**. An open review box on a
marketplace is a reputation weapon — competitors bury each other, sellers
inflate themselves, and the stars that gate every buying decision stop meaning
anything.

- `GET /reviews/for/:listingId` — `{ canReview, code, reason, mine }`.
  `code` is `OK`, `NOT_PURCHASED`, `OWN_LISTING`, or `GONE`. Ownership is
  checked **before** purchase, so a seller is told they own it rather than being
  sent off to buy their own item.
- `POST /reviews` — `{ listingId, rating, body }`. An upsert: writing again
  edits the existing review. One per person per listing, by unique index.
- `PATCH /reviews/:id` · `DELETE /reviews/:id` — author only; 404 otherwise.

`GET /catalog/listings/:slug` returns `ratingBreakdown` and a per-review
`verified` flag. That flag is **computed against real paid orders**, not
assumed — seeded reviews have no order behind them, and a badge that isn't
earned devalues every badge on the site.

---

## Reports — `/reports` 🔒

Anyone signed in can report a listing, a review, or an account.

### `GET /reports/reasons`

The list the UI renders. Codes are stable; labels are not.

### `POST /reports`

```json
{ "targetType": "LISTING", "targetId": "uuid", "reason": "COUNTERFEIT", "detail": "optional" }
```

**409 `ALREADY_REPORTED`** if you have already reported that thing — one voice
per person, so a queue cannot be brigaded by one account clicking repeatedly.
**404** for a target that does not exist.

---

## Admin — `/admin` 🔒👮

Two separate gates, and being past the first does not get you past the second.

**👮 = a live admin session**, which is *not* the ordinary login cookie. It is a
distinct `kintsugi_admin` cookie, signed with a secret derived from
`JWT_SECRET`, lasting **30 minutes**. Obtaining one needs the password **again**
plus a TOTP code. See
[ADR 0006](adr/0006-kyc-store-reference-not-document.md) for the identity side;
the reasoning here is the same — a stolen shopping cookie must not carry the
power to suspend accounts.

`role: ADMIN` is granted **only by CLI** (`npm run admin:grant`). There is no
promotion endpoint, and adding one would defeat the arrangement: the whole
point is that granting admin needs shell access to the server, not a session in
a browser.

Failures return **401 `ADMIN_SESSION_REQUIRED`**, or **403 `ADMIN_REVOKED`** if
the role was withdrawn while a session was still live — the role is re-read
from the database on every request, so revocation takes effect immediately
rather than when the token expires.

### Step-up

| Route | Needs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/session` | 🔒 | `{ isAdmin, needsTotpSetup }`. Plain `false` for non-admins, not a 403 — this decides whether to render a link. |
| `POST /admin/totp/setup` | 🔒 + password | Returns `{ qrDataUrl, secret }`. Stored unconfirmed. |
| `POST /admin/totp/confirm` | 🔒 + code | Sets `totpConfirmedAt`. Until then the enrolment does not count. |
| `POST /admin/session` | 🔒 + password + code | Mints the admin cookie. Rate limited to **8 per 15 min**. |
| `GET /admin/session/active` | 👮 | `{ active, secondsLeft }`, read from the token's own `exp`. |
| `POST /admin/session/end` | 🔒 | Clears the cookie. |

A wrong password and a wrong code return the **same** message. Distinguishing
them would tell an attacker which half they had already solved.

**Codes are single-use.** A valid code spans about 90 seconds here, because one
30-second step either side is accepted for clock drift — so without this the
same six digits keep working for that whole window, and a code seen over a
shoulder or relayed by a phishing proxy can be spent again by someone else.
`User.totpLastUsedAt` records the period last accepted, and anything from that
period or earlier is refused with the same generic message. The claim is an
atomic conditional UPDATE, so two requests carrying the same code cannot both
win a read-then-write race.

One consequence worth knowing: finishing enrolment spends a code, so the very
next step-up needs the *next* one. The panel says so rather than letting someone
retype the digits their app is still displaying.

### Dashboard — all read-only

| Route | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/metrics?days=7\|30\|90` | Headline figures, a daily series, `attention`, `topSellers`, `recentOrders` |
| `GET /admin/orders?q=&status=&page=` | Paged orders; searches reference, buyer name, buyer email |
| `GET /admin/orders/:id` | One order: lines, ship-to snapshot, payment reference |
| `GET /admin/customers?q=&filter=&page=` | Paged accounts; `filter=ALL\|SELLERS\|SUSPENDED\|ADMINS` |
| `GET /admin/customers/:id` | One account: lifetime spend, recent orders, shop, reports against |
| `GET /admin/catalogue?q=&status=&page=` | Paged listings; `status` adds `REMOVED` for soft-deleted |
| `GET /admin/overview` | Bare counts, used for the sidebar badge |
| `GET /admin/reports?status=` | The moderation queue, **oldest first** |
| `GET /admin/audit` | Every moderation action, newest first |
| `GET /admin/deliveries?q=&channel=&status=&page=` | The delivery ledger. `q` takes an email address, a name, or an `eventId`; `channel=EMAIL\|PUSH\|SMS`; `status` adds `DEFERRED` and `PENDING`. Also returns `byStatus` for the whole filtered set |

Lists page at **25**, returning `{ rows, total, page, pages, pageSize }`.

`metrics` counts **only `PAID` orders**, and the figure is labelled *gross
sales*, never revenue: Kintsugi takes no cut, so none of it is the platform's.
Period-on-period deltas come back **`null`**, not `0` or `100`, when the prior
period had nothing to compare against.

The report queue returns `reporterName` and **never the reporter's email**.

`deliveries` answers "did the buyer get the refund email?" — a real support
question that previously needed a database console. Each row carries *why*, not
just what: `suppressReason` for a channel the recipient turned off,
`lastError` for a provider that refused, `notBefore` for something quiet hours
parked. `recipient` is **null** when the account has since been deleted, because
the ledger has no foreign key to `users` and a delivery record has to outlive
the account it was for.

**There is no message body in the response, and there is not meant to be.** The
ledger records that something was sent, not what it said
([ADR 0026](adr/0026-delivery-idempotency.md)), and this endpoint must not
become the place that leaks it.

### Actions — every one writes an audit row

| Route | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /admin/listings/:id/remove` | Soft delete. Orders containing it keep working. |
| `POST /admin/listings/:id/restore` | Returns it as **`DRAFT`**, never straight to live — republishing is the seller's call. |
| `POST /admin/reviews/:id/remove` | Soft delete. |
| `POST /admin/users/:id/suspend` | Blocks sign-in. Deletes nothing. |
| `POST /admin/users/:id/reinstate` | Lifts it. |
| `POST /admin/reports/:id/resolve` | Closes a report; `dismissed: true` records "looked, found nothing". |

All take `{ reason, reportId? }`. **`reason` is required** (3–1000 chars) and is
shown verbatim to the person affected — **400 `REASON_REQUIRED`** without one.
An audit row that reads only "suspended by X" is useless six months later, and
someone whose listing vanished is owed the reason.

**400** for suspending yourself, **403 `CANNOT_SUSPEND_ADMIN`** for suspending
another admin — revoke the role from the CLI first. Both are checked *before*
"already suspended", so the answer does not depend on the target's current
state.

## Webhooks — `/webhooks/stripe`

Signature-verified, raw body, mounted **before** `express.json()` — Stripe signs
the exact bytes, so a parsed and re-serialised body fails every time.

Handles `payment_intent.*`, `refund.*` / `charge.refund.updated`, and
`identity.verification_session.*`. Note that `requires_input` means both
"hasn't started" and "was refused"; only `last_error` separates them.

`charge.refunded` is deliberately **not** handled. It fires alongside the
refund-object events but carries a Charge, whose `refunds` list would need
separate unwrapping — two code paths for one fact, the second only ever
agreeing with the first.

Unknown events and unknown ids return **200**, because a non-2xx tells Stripe to
retry forever.

## Static files

### `GET /uploads/:key`

Processed seller images. Keys are server-generated (32 hex + extension) and
served immutable with a one-year cache, since they are never reused.

In development Next.js needs `images.dangerouslyAllowLocalIP` to optimise these,
because Next 16 blocks image optimisation from private IPs as SSRF protection.
It is scoped to development only — in production these come from object storage
on a public hostname.
