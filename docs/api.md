# API Reference

Express API, default `http://localhost:4000`.

The browser does not call these directly. It calls the matching BFF path under
`/api/*` on the Next.js server, which forwards them
([ADR 0002](adr/0002-bff-proxy.md)). `POST /auth/login` in this document is
`POST /api/auth/login` from the browser.

## Conventions

**Auth.** Session state travels in two `httpOnly` cookies. Requests marked
🔒 need a valid access token; 🏪 additionally requires a seller profile.

**Errors.** Consistent JSON:

```json
{ "error": "Human-readable message.", "code": "MACHINE_CODE", "field": "priceCents" }
```

`field` appears when one input is at fault, so the UI can render the message
against that input. `code` is stable; `error` text is not.

| Status | Meaning here |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Validation failed |
| 401 | No or expired session |
| 403 | Authenticated but not permitted (`NOT_A_SELLER`, `PAYOUTS_LOCKED`) |
| 404 | Not found — **also returned for records owned by someone else** |
| 409 | Conflict with current state (`ALREADY_VERIFIED`, `SESSION_CLOSED`) |
| 429 | Rate limited; includes `retryAfterSeconds` |
| 500 | Server error; details are logged, not returned |

**Money** is integer minor units (`priceCents`) in bodies. The one exception is
`/catalog/listings`, whose `minPrice`/`maxPrice` are whole currency units
because that is what a price filter collects.

## Health

### `GET /health`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "service": "kintsugi-backend" }
```

---

## Auth — `/auth`

### `POST /auth/signup`

```json
{ "name": "Ada Lovelace", "email": "ada@example.com", "password": "at least 12 chars" }
```

Password must be ≥ 12 characters and is checked against Pwned Passwords
([ADR 0004](adr/0004-password-policy.md)). No session is created — the account
must be verified first.

`201` → `{ "message": "...", "email": "ada@example.com" }`

| Failure | Code | `field` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password too short | `INVALID_INPUT` | `password` |
| Password found in breach corpora | `PASSWORD_BREACHED` | `password` |
| Email already registered **and verified** | `EMAIL_IN_USE` | `email` |

Signing up again on an *unverified* email is not an error: it re-sends the link
and updates the stored password hash.

> With no email provider configured, the verification link is printed to the
> backend console.

### `POST /auth/verify-email`

```json
{ "token": "<from the emailed link>" }
```

Single-use, 24-hour expiry. `200` → `{ "user": { ... } }` and a session is
established.

### `POST /auth/resend-verification`

```json
{ "email": "ada@example.com" }
```

Always `200` — it does not reveal whether the address is registered.

### `POST /auth/login`

```json
{ "email": "ada@example.com", "password": "..." }
```

`200` → `{ "user": { ... } }`, sets both cookies.

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong email or password | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` |
| Email not verified | `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` |

Login is hard-blocked until verified — no partial session.

### `POST /auth/refresh`

Rotates the refresh token and issues a new access token. `204` with new
cookies.

Presenting an already-rotated token revokes the entire token family: reuse
means the credential leaked. → [ADR 0001](adr/0001-access-and-refresh-tokens.md)

### `POST /auth/logout`

Revokes the refresh token and clears cookies. `204`.

### `GET /auth/me` 🔒

```json
{ "user": { "id": "…", "name": "Ada Lovelace", "email": "ada@example.com",
            "isSeller": false, "emailVerified": true, "createdAt": "…" } }
```

### `POST /auth/become-seller` 🔒

Sets `isSeller` and creates the `SellerProfile` in one transaction. Idempotent.
`200` → `{ "user": { ... } }`

---

## Profile — `/profile` 🔒

### `POST /profile/avatar`

`multipart/form-data`, field name `avatar`. JPEG, PNG, or WebP; max 5 MB; 10
uploads per user per hour.

Validated by **magic bytes**, cropped to a 512×512 square, and re-encoded to
WebP — which strips EXIF including GPS. The image is written to object storage
and only its URL is stored on the user row
([ADR 0011](adr/0011-avatars-in-object-storage.md)).

Replacing an existing picture deletes the previous object, but only after the
new URL is committed — so a failed write never leaves an account with no
picture.

`200` → `{ "user": { ..., "avatarUrl": "https://…/uploads/<key>.webp" } }`

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Not a real image | `INVALID_IMAGE` |
| Over 5 MB / unreadable upload | `UPLOAD_FAILED` |
| Nothing attached | `NO_FILE` |
| Hourly cap hit | `RATE_LIMITED` |

### `DELETE /profile/avatar`

Clears `avatarUrl` and deletes the stored object. The UI falls back to generated
initials.

`200` → `{ "user": { ..., "avatarUrl": null } }`

---

## Catalog — `/catalog` (public)

Only listings with `status = ACTIVE` and `deletedAt IS NULL` are ever returned.

### `GET /catalog/categories`

```json
{ "categories": [
  { "id": "…", "slug": "furniture-home", "title": "Furniture & Home",
    "description": "…", "coverImage": "https://…", "listingCount": 3 }
] }
```

`listingCount` counts visible listings only.

### `GET /catalog/listings`

| Param | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string | Case-insensitive substring of title or description |
| `category` | slug | |
| `condition` | enum | `LIKE_NEW` \| `GOOD` \| `WELL_LOVED` \| `NEEDS_REPAIR` |
| `minPrice`, `maxPrice` | number | **Whole currency units** |
| `featured` | `true` \| `false` | |
| `sort` | enum | `newest` (default), `price_asc`, `price_desc` |
| `page` | int | Default 1 |
| `limit` | int | Default 24, max 48 |

Empty-string params are treated as absent, so an untouched filter form is a
valid request.

```json
{
  "listings": [ { /* listing */ } ],
  "total": 13, "page": 1, "limit": 24, "pageCount": 1
}
```

Listing object:

```json
{
  "id": "…", "slug": "brown-leather-jacket",
  "title": "Brown leather jacket", "description": "…",
  "condition": "LIKE_NEW", "conditionNote": "Like new",
  "priceCents": 12000, "originalPriceCents": 15000, "currency": "USD",
  "quantity": 1, "featured": false, "createdAt": "2026-08-19T…",
  "category": { "slug": "clothing-accessories", "title": "Clothing & Accessories" },
  "seller":   { "shopName": "Kintsugi Collection", "verified": true },
  "images":   [ { "url": "https://…", "alt": "…", "position": 0 } ],
  "rating":   { "average": 4.8, "count": 5 }
}
```

`rating.average` is `null` when there are no reviews — not `0`.
`seller.verified` is derived from KYC status and exposes no verification detail.

`400 INVALID_PRICE_RANGE` when `minPrice > maxPrice`.

### `GET /catalog/listings/:slug`

Adds `reviews` to the listing (newest 20) and a sibling `related` array (up to
4 from the same category).

```json
{
  "listing": { "…": "…", "reviews": [
    { "id": "…", "rating": 5, "body": "…", "createdAt": "…", "authorName": "Noah Brenner" }
  ] },
  "related": [ { /* listing */ } ]
}
```

`404 NOT_FOUND` if the slug is unknown, unpublished, or soft-deleted.

---

## Reservations — `/reservations` 🔒

A short-lived hold on stock, taken before checkout exists to convert it. This is
where the oversell race is prevented: availability is decided inside a
transaction holding `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the listing row, so two buyers can
never both claim the same unique item.
→ [ADR 0012](adr/0012-row-locking-for-reservations.md)

### `GET /reservations`

Your live holds, newest first, plus `holdMinutes` (currently 15).

### `POST /reservations`

```json
{ "listingId": "<id>", "quantity": 1 }
```

`201` → `{ "reservation": { "id", "listingId", "quantity", "expiresAt", "remainingQuantity" } }`

Stock is decremented and the listing flips to `RESERVED` once it reaches zero —
distinct from `SOLD`, because no money has moved.

| Failure | Code | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nothing left | `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` | 409 |
| Sold, draft, or removed | `UNAVAILABLE` | 409 |
| You already hold it | `ALREADY_HELD` | 409 |
| It's your own listing | `OWN_LISTING` | 400 |
| Unknown listing | `NOT_FOUND` | 404 |

**Losing a race is a 409, not a 500.** Contention is an expected outcome.

### `DELETE /reservations/:id`

Releases the hold and returns the stock, flipping the listing back to `ACTIVE`.
`204`.

Holds also expire on their own after 15 minutes, and expired stock is reclaimed
lazily the next time someone tries to reserve that listing — so correctness
doesn't depend on a background job.

---

## Seller — `/seller` 🔒🏪

Non-sellers receive `403 NOT_A_SELLER`.

Every route is scoped to the caller's own records. **A listing owned by another
seller returns 404, not 403** — a 403 would confirm the id exists.

### `GET /seller/me`

```json
{ "seller": { "id": "…", "shopName": "…", "bio": null,
              "kycStatus": "UNSTARTED", "payoutsEnabled": false, "createdAt": "…" },
  "counts": { "DRAFT": 2, "ACTIVE": 5 } }
```

### `GET /seller/listings`

All of the caller's listings, any status, newest-updated first. Excludes
soft-deleted.

### `GET /seller/listings/:id`

### `POST /seller/listings`

```json
{
  "title": "Walnut side table",
  "description": "At least 10 characters.",
  "categoryId": "<uuid>",
  "condition": "GOOD",
  "conditionNote": "Water ring",
  "priceCents": 8500,
  "originalPriceCents": 11000,
  "quantity": 1,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

Constraints: `title` 3–120, `description` 10–4000, `conditionNote` ≤ 60,
`priceCents` ≥ 1, `quantity` 1–999, and `originalPriceCents` must exceed
`priceCents`.

Created as `DRAFT`. `slug` is derived from the title and fixed thereafter.

`201` → `{ "listing": { ... } }`

### `PATCH /seller/listings/:id`

Accepts any subset of the create body. The `slug` is **not** regenerated when
the title changes. `409 LISTING_SOLD` if the listing is sold.

### `POST /seller/listings/:id/publish`

`DRAFT` → `ACTIVE`.

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| No photos | `NEEDS_PHOTO` |
| Already sold | `LISTING_SOLD` |

Deliberately **not** gated on identity verification
([ADR 0007](adr/0007-verification-gates-payouts.md)).

### `POST /seller/listings/:id/unpublish`

`ACTIVE` → `DRAFT`.

### `DELETE /seller/listings/:id`

Soft delete: sets `deletedAt` and `status = REMOVED`. `204`.

### `POST /seller/listings/:id/images`

`multipart/form-data`, field name `image`. JPEG, PNG, or WebP; max 8 MB; max 8
images per listing; 30 uploads per user per hour.

The file is validated by **magic bytes** (not extension or `Content-Type`) and
re-encoded to WebP, which strips EXIF including GPS.

`201` → `{ "image": { "id": "…", "url": "…", "alt": "…", "position": 0 } }`

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Not a real image | `INVALID_IMAGE` |
| Over 8 MB / unreadable upload | `UPLOAD_FAILED` |
| Nothing attached | `NO_FILE` |
| Already 8 images | `TOO_MANY_IMAGES` |
| Hourly cap hit | `RATE_LIMITED` |

### `DELETE /seller/listings/:id/images/:imageId`

`204`. Returns `400 NEEDS_PHOTO` when removing the only photo of a published
listing.

---

## Verification & payouts — `/seller` 🔒🏪

### `GET /seller/verification`

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "status": "REJECTED", "provider": "stub",
    "documentType": "drivers_license", "country": "GB",
    "verifiedAt": null,
    "rejectionReason": "The document image couldn't be read clearly.",
    "payoutsEnabled": false,
    "isStub": true
  },
  "attempts": [ { "id": "…", "provider": "stub", "providerSessionId": "…",
                  "status": "REJECTED", "documentType": "drivers_license",
                  "country": "GB", "rejectionReason": "…",
                  "createdAt": "…", "completedAt": "…" } ]
}
```

`isStub` is exposed so the UI can say no real check occurred. Up to 10 attempts
are returned, newest first.

### `POST /seller/verification`

Starts a session, or resumes an in-flight one rather than creating a duplicate.
Max 5 per hour.

`201` → `{ "session": { "providerSessionId": "…", "redirectUrl": "…" }, "resumed": false }`
`200` → same shape with `"resumed": true` when an open session already exists.

`409 ALREADY_VERIFIED` once verified.

### `POST /seller/verification/:sessionId/submit`

```json
{ "documentType": "passport", "country": "US", "documentNumber": "…" }
```

`documentType` ∈ `passport` | `drivers_license` | `national_id`; `country` is a
2-letter code (normalised to uppercase); `documentNumber` is 6–40 characters.

> **`documentNumber` is never stored.** It is evaluated and discarded — not
> persisted, not logged, not returned.
> → [ADR 0006](adr/0006-kyc-store-reference-not-document.md)

Stub outcomes: number ending `0000` → rejected (unreadable), `0001` → rejected
(name mismatch), anything else → verified.

`200` → `{ "outcome": "VERIFIED", "rejectionReason": null, "payoutsEnabled": true }`

| Failure | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown session, or another seller's | `NOT_FOUND` (404) |
| Session already resolved | `SESSION_CLOSED` (409) |

With a real provider this transition would arrive as a signature-verified
webhook rather than a client submission.

### `GET /seller/payouts`

`403 PAYOUTS_LOCKED` (with `kycStatus`) until verified. This is the payout gate,
enforced server-side rather than only in the UI.

Once verified:

```json
{ "payouts": { "enabled": true, "balanceCents": 0, "currency": "USD",
               "history": [],
               "note": "Checkout isn't built yet, so there's nothing to pay out." } }
```

The zero balance is honest, not a placeholder — no checkout exists, so no money
has moved.

---

## Static files

### `GET /uploads/:key`

Processed seller images. Keys are server-generated (32 hex + extension) and
served immutable with a one-year cache, since they are never reused.

In development Next.js needs `images.dangerouslyAllowLocalIP` to optimise these,
because Next 16 blocks image optimisation from private IPs as SSRF protection.
It is scoped to development only — in production these come from object storage
on a public hostname.
