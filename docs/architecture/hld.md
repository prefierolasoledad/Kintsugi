# High-Level Design

Scope: the whole system, its containers, and the cross-cutting concerns that
apply everywhere. For per-module detail see [lld.md](lld.md).

## 1. System context

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph people["People"]
        Buyer["Buyer<br/><i>browses, saves items</i>"]
        Seller["Seller<br/><i>lists items, verifies identity</i>"]
    end

    K["<b>Kintsugi</b><br/>Secondhand marketplace"]

    subgraph ext["External systems"]
        Pwned["Pwned Passwords API<br/><i>k-anonymity breach check</i>"]
        Mail["Email provider<br/><i>SMTP via nodemailer</i>"]
        Kyc["Stripe Identity<br/><i>test mode; stub behind a seam</i>"]
        Pay["Stripe Payments<br/><i>test mode; stub behind a seam</i>"]
        CDN["Image hosting<br/><i>local disk — object storage is the seam</i>"]
    end

    Buyer --> K
    Seller --> K
    K -->|"SHA-1 prefix only"| Pwned
    K -.-> Mail
    K -.-> Kyc
    K -.->|"intents, refunds, webhooks"| Pay
    K --> CDN
```

Dotted lines are **provider seams**: one interface with a real integration and a
stub behind it, selected by an environment variable. The stub is not a
placeholder for missing code — it is what CI runs against, so a pull request
from a fork gets a meaningful green run without any credentials. See
[§6 Deliberate stubs](#6-deliberate-stubs).

## 2. Containers

| Container | Runtime | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Storefront + BFF** | Next.js 16, Node | Renders the UI; proxies all browser API traffic to Express |
| **API** | Express 4, Node | Business rules, persistence, authorisation, image processing |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 | System of record |
| **Cache & counters** | Redis 7 | Rate-limit counters and read-through cache. Holds nothing that must survive a restart — see [ADR 0018](../adr/0018-redis-for-shared-ephemeral-state.md) |
| **Standby** *(opt-in)* | PostgreSQL 16 | A byte-for-byte streaming clone, ~11ms behind. Read-only, and nothing queries it — it exists to be promoted. `--profile ha`. See [ADR 0020](../adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md) |
| **Object storage** | MinIO (S3-compatible) | Processed photos and avatars, fetched by the browser directly. Anonymous read on objects only — see [ADR 0022](../adr/0022-object-storage-for-uploads.md) |

Two Node processes, deliberately. The Next.js server holds no business logic —
it renders and forwards. Every rule is enforced in Express, so a client that
bypasses the UI gains nothing.

### Where rendering happens

| Route | Mode | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/`, `/search`, `/shop/[category]`, `/listing/[slug]` | Server-rendered per request | Inventory changes; must not be stale |
| `/seller/*`, `/account`, `/cart`, `/wishlist` | Client components | Need client auth state and interactivity |
| `/api/*` | Route handlers | The BFF |

Public catalog pages are fetched in server components that call Express
**directly**, not through `/api/*`. The Next server *is* the BFF, so routing a
server-side read through its own HTTP handler would add a hop for nothing. The
BFF exists for *browser* traffic.

## 3. Request lifecycle

A browser-initiated, authenticated call:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Br as Browser
    participant BFF as Next.js /api/*
    participant API as Express
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Br->>BFF: fetch("/api/seller/listings")<br/>cookies attached automatically
    BFF->>API: GET /seller/listings<br/>cookie header relayed
    API->>API: requireAuth → verify access token
    API->>DB: SELECT ... WHERE sellerId = :caller
    DB-->>API: rows
    API-->>BFF: 200 JSON
    BFF-->>Br: 200 JSON
```

When the access token has expired:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Br as Browser
    participant BFF as Next.js /api/*
    participant API as Express

    Br->>BFF: fetch("/api/seller/listings")
    BFF->>API: GET /seller/listings
    API-->>BFF: 401
    BFF->>API: POST /auth/refresh
    API-->>BFF: 204 + rotated cookies
    BFF->>API: retry original request with new cookies
    API-->>BFF: 200 JSON
    BFF-->>Br: 200 JSON + Set-Cookie
```

The retry is invisible to the caller. Endpoints that legitimately return 401 —
`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/verify-email`,
`/auth/resend-verification` — are excluded, otherwise a wrong password would
trigger a refresh loop.

## 4. Security model

### Session handling

| Token | Form | Lifetime | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access | Signed JWT | 15 minutes | `httpOnly` cookie |
| Refresh | Opaque random string | 30 days | `httpOnly` cookie; **SHA-256 hash** in DB |

Cookies are `httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax`, and `secure` in production. No token is
readable by JavaScript, so XSS cannot exfiltrate a session.

Refresh tokens are stored hashed. A database leak yields hashes, not usable
sessions — the same reasoning as password hashing, applied to a credential
that is equally sufficient to impersonate someone.

**Rotation with reuse detection.** Each refresh issues a new token and marks
the old one replaced. Presenting an already-rotated token means it leaked, so
the whole family is revoked and the session dies. The legitimate user logs in
again; the attacker gains nothing lasting.

### Passwords

A 12-character minimum plus a breach check against Pwned Passwords, instead of
composition rules. `P@ssw0rd1` satisfies every "one upper, one digit, one
symbol" policy and is also in every breach corpus. Length and
known-compromise are the properties that correlate with real resistance.

The check sends the **first five characters of the SHA-1 hash** and filters the
returned range locally, so the password is never transmitted. The check fails
open: if the API is unreachable, signup proceeds rather than blocking
registration on a third party.
→ [ADR 0004](../adr/0004-password-policy.md)

### Authorisation

Authentication establishes *who*; it never establishes *what they may touch*.
Two middlewares compose:

- `requireAuth` — validates the access token, sets `req.userId`
- `requireSeller` — resolves the caller's `SellerProfile`, sets `req.sellerId`

Every seller query is then scoped by `sellerId`. A listing belonging to someone
else returns **404, not 403**: a 403 confirms the id exists and would let
someone enumerate other sellers' inventory.

### Uploads

Untrusted bytes get three treatments before storage:

1. **Magic-byte sniffing** — the header is inspected. Filename extensions and
   client `Content-Type` are attacker-controlled and prove nothing.
2. **Re-encode via Sharp** — output is a fresh WebP. Sharp does not copy
   metadata unless asked, which strips EXIF *including GPS*. Sellers photograph
   items inside their homes; publishing that metadata would leak home
   addresses. `.rotate()` runs first so orientation survives.
3. **Bounds** — 8 MB per file, 8 images per listing, 2000 px longest edge,
   a 50-megapixel decode cap against decompression bombs, and 30 uploads per
   user per hour.

### Identity data

No government ID is ever stored: no image, no document number, no date of
birth. Those values pass through memory and are discarded. What persists is a
provider session id, document *type*, issuing country, outcome, and timestamp.

Holding ID documents would make the database a high-value breach target and
pull it under special-category data rules (GDPR Art. 9-adjacent; India's DPDP
Act treats them similarly) for no product benefit.
→ [ADR 0006](../adr/0006-kyc-store-reference-not-document.md)

### Trust boundaries

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph untrusted["Untrusted"]
        Browser["Browser<br/><i>all input hostile</i>"]
    end
    subgraph edge["Edge — no business rules"]
        Next["Next.js server"]
    end
    subgraph trusted["Trusted — all rules enforced here"]
        Express["Express API"]
        DB[("PostgreSQL")]
    end

    Browser -->|"validated by Zod at the boundary"| Next
    Next --> Express
    Express --> DB
```

Because the BFF forwards without interpreting, it is not a security control.
Nothing is enforced only in Next.js or only in the UI. Disabled buttons are a
courtesy; the server re-checks. Publishing without a photo is rejected by the
API even though the button is greyed out.

## 5. Cross-cutting concerns

**Validation.** Zod parses every request body and query string at the route
boundary. Errors carry a machine-readable `code` and, where applicable, the
offending `field`, which the UI attaches to the specific input.

**Money.** Integer minor units (`priceCents`) everywhere. Write endpoints
accept cents so no float rounding is possible in transit; the search API accepts
whole currency units because that is what a price filter collects.
→ [ADR 0005](../adr/0005-money-as-integer-minor-units.md)

**Deletion.** Listings soft-delete (`deletedAt` + `status = REMOVED`). A
listing referenced by a past order must stay resolvable. All catalog reads
filter on `deletedAt: null` and `status: ACTIVE`.
→ [ADR 0008](../adr/0008-soft-delete-and-listing-status.md)

**Public URLs.** A listing's `slug` is generated once at creation and never
regenerated when the title changes, so existing links keep working.

**Errors.** Every route wraps its handler; failures log server-side with
context and return a generic message. Internal details are not sent to clients.

## 6. Provider seams

Four concerns sit behind an interface with two implementations — a real one and
a stub — selected by an environment variable. Each is a single module, so
changing provider means editing one file.

| Concern | Module | Real | Stub | Selected by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payments | `lib/paymentProvider.ts` | Stripe PaymentIntents + Refunds | In-process intents with test card numbers | `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` |
| Identity | `lib/kycProvider.ts` | Stripe Identity | Deterministic outcomes by document-number suffix | `KYC_PROVIDER` |
| Email | `lib/mailer.ts` | SMTP via nodemailer | Console, or Ethereal's throwaway inbox | `MAIL_TRANSPORT` |
| File storage | `lib/storage.ts` | — | Local disk | *(not yet swappable)* |

**The stubs are not placeholders for missing code.** They are what CI runs
against: the suite drives the whole purchase, refund and verification flow with
no credentials configured, which is why a pull request from a fork — unable to
read repository secrets — still gets a meaningful green run. The Stripe paths
are exercised separately against test mode.

The API reports `isStub: true` and the UI says so on screen. A stub that
silently looks real is worse than no stub.

File storage is the one seam with no second implementation yet. `putFile`,
`removeFile` and `publicUrl` are the whole surface; S3, R2 or Cloudinary
replaces those three.

## 7. Known limitations

- **No payouts to sellers.** The largest remaining gap. Money reaches the
  platform and can be refunded from it; paying sellers out needs Stripe Connect.
  `payoutsEnabled` is set by identity verification and nothing consumes it yet.
- **Uploads live on local disk.** They do not survive a replacement container
  and are not shared between replicas — which means the API cannot currently be
  run with more than one replica, whatever else is shared. This is why the
  storage seam exists. It also means seller photos do not render under Compose:
  the browser loads them from `localhost:4000`, unreachable from inside the web
  container.
- **Failover is manual, and nothing is automatically replaced.** Both tiers can
  now run more than one replica — rate limits and the cache are in Redis
  ([ADR 0018](../adr/0018-redis-for-shared-ephemeral-state.md),
  [ADR 0019](../adr/0019-cache-tiering-rule.md)), the refresh race is settled in
  Postgres ([ADR 0021](../adr/0021-refresh-race-grace-window.md)), and uploads
  are in shared object storage
  ([ADR 0022](../adr/0022-object-storage-for-uploads.md)). What is missing is
  anything that *notices* a dead instance and replaces it, which is an
  orchestrator's job rather than the application's.
- **Search is substring matching** (`ILIKE '%q%'`), which cannot use a B-tree
  index, so every search is a sequential scan. Fine at this size; a Postgres
  `tsvector` index with ranking is the upgrade path.
- **Pagination is offset-based.** Simple and right for numbered result pages;
  deep offsets degrade.
- **No backups.** A streaming standby exists and is verified — see
  [ADR 0020](../adr/0020-replication-and-backups.md) — but replication is not
  backup: it copies a mistaken `DROP TABLE` faithfully and in milliseconds.
  WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery is outstanding, along with rehearsing
  a restore, since a backup that has never been restored is not a backup.
- **Failover is manual.** Nothing promotes the standby. Compose cannot express
  it; CloudNativePG can, which is part of why Kubernetes is next.
- **Nothing reads from the replica**, deliberately. Routing reads to a standby
  introduces read-your-writes bugs — a buyer landing on an order list that has
  not replayed their order — and the caching in
  [ADR 0019](../adr/0019-cache-tiering-rule.md) already absorbed the read volume
  a replica would have relieved.
- **Aggregate ratings are computed per request.** One extra grouped query per
  page. Denormalising onto `Listing` is the optimisation, at the cost of
  keeping it consistent.
- **No automated test suite.** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#testing).
